The one element of those opening remarks that remains unchanged from one fall to the next is an unwavering affirmation, “Who comes here belongs here.” If ever there was a time for William & Mary to re-affirm that foundational claim in both words and actions, now is that time.  Each one of you belongs here – you were specially chosen to be a part of this campus community, and you are of immeasurable worth because of the diverse experiences, perspectives, identities, traditions, affiliations, and abilities you bring with you. What can never belong here at W&M are any behaviors that harass, intimidate, or threaten others.  It grieves me to know that students in our community are witnessing or directly experiencing such behaviors, as well as the accompanying pain, confusion, and fear they engender. Since last week’s presidential election, students have shared with us, both anonymously and through more formal channels, information about such threats and harassment. Just yesterday, we received a disturbing report about graffiti written on a paper towel dispenser in a hall bathroom in a residence hall. An image of the graffiti, which included the words “Go Trump” with a swastika substituting for the “T” has been widely circulated on social media. No one has come forward to claim responsibility or motive, and we encourage anyone with information about the incident to contact William & Mary Police at 221-4596. Yesterday afternoon, students, faculty and administrators gathered in Tucker Hall to talk about the climate on campus, to ask questions, and to support one another during this turbulent time.  A number of you asked for more information about our campus policies, avenues for reporting discrimination and harassment, and a list of campus resources.  I hope this specially-designed website is helpful – please reach out and let us know what else you might need.  The university will follow-up on reports to the best of our ability using the information provided.  Above all, leverage the trusting relationships you have established at William & Mary with faculty members, with administrators, with mentors, and with your friends. And may we each commit to listening more, with compassion and with respect.

While members of Dickson Hall said that their R.A.s have called or will soon call floor meetings in response to the incidents, none of the several CKB residents interviewed by The Sun were aware that someone drew a swastika in their living space. Deepak Ilango ’22, a resident of the fifth floor of Dickson Hall, confirmed to The Sun that the R.A. sent out an email about the incident and called a floor meeting to address the issue on Thursday. Zain Mehdi’20, one of the residential advisors in Dickson Hall, also said that he hopes to call a mandatory floor meeting soon to broach the subject to his residents “face-to-face.” The “support gathering” held on Thursday was attended by 13 individuals, roughly half of whom were administrators rather than students. One student participant told The Sun she was not aware of the incidents nor the support meeting until she accidentally walked into the Robert Purcell Community Center auditorium.

Rabbi Ari. D. Weiss, executive director of Cornell Hillel, said that the University considers the safety of Jewish students “very seriously,” adding that CUPD now has an increased presence in “recognizably Jewish events” such as services and Friday dinner at 104 West —  a Kosher dining hall. Furthermore, the campus police are training student leaders and Hillel staff on “emergency procedures,” and creating a “site-specific plan” for the Hillel office.

In addition to strengthening security, the Hillel director is also planning a series of campus outreach efforts, such as a “robust programmatic response” starting next semester to improve awareness about Jewish culture and the swastika signs.

“We believe that Hillel has a role in educating the campus community about the history of antiSemitism and how antisemitism manifests today in 21st-century America,” Weiss said, elaborating on the topics Hillel expects to cover in its planned programming.",,school administration,letters/statements,school administration,gathering/protest/vigil/demonstration,student group,victim support,religious leaders,victim support,"letters/statements, gathering/protest/vigil/demonstration, victim support, victim support",

Thinking about moving forward following the College’s latest swastika incident, Rabbi Asch emphasized education and cross-campus relations and said, “I think, given the Community Conversations that are happening on campus now and the Holocaust Memorial Lecture that’s coming up on Tuesday, those are two ways for people to proactively do something not directly about this but either to educate themselves about the Holocaust or to intentionally be in conversation with people at Colby that have different backgrounds than they do.",student doesn't think the school has done enough,school administration,letters/statements,religious leaders,gathering/protest/vigil/demonstration,,,,,"letters/statements, gathering/protest/vigil/demonstration",

“Our campus is already struggling with so much anger and pain,” Gardner wrote. “And that is even more reason to reiterate: the use of symbols of hate and violence is not acceptable in our community and causes lasting harm.”

Earlier in the evening, University Housing hosted a round table conversation regarding racism, bias and free speech issues. Gardner said they will schedule a similar conversation at Aggie Village next week.

“This is just the beginning of what we hope will be an engaged process to explore and address these topics as a community as we move through this year,” Gardner wrote.

In her fall address Thursday, Colorado State University President Joyce McConnell confirmed the incident. 

“Last night, we discovered a swastika on the wall in one of our apartment complexes,” McConnell said. “Whether individual or institutional, racism and bias is antithetical to the core mission of excellent higher education.”

“A swastika was found drawn in the snow on a sign near the Dimple. This is the third such incident this semester.

The college also stepped up security.

“There is a lot of student support. It’s a very supportive community,” Yans said.

The person or persons responsible for the incidents have not been found, but campus police are investigating.

The president added that as antiSemitism and “ugly forms of bias” become more frequent, the Emerson community will stand against such acts.

“Our hope shall always be that, out of the rich diversity of human experience, we can continue to create a community of learning—one made both beautiful and effective by its pluralism, one that will turn the tide of human want into a sea of joy and light,” he said.  The college will hold a community vigil Thursday, Emerson’s Director of Spiritual and Religious Life Julie Avis Rogers said in a statement Wednesday evening. The 4 p.m. vigil will be led by Rogers and the college’s Jewish Advisor Jake Freedman at the college’s

Rogers said the community is “heavy hearted, angry, sad, and perhaps even numbed,” by the graffiti.

“We at Emerson are greatly gifted by the presence of our Jewish community members; we are blessed by the wisdom and beauty found within the Jewish tradition, and we are a stronger community because of the vision of justice and compassion that the Jewish tradition exemplifies for us,” she said.",,school administration,letters/statements,school administration,gathering/protest/vigil/demonstration,,,,,"letters/statements, gathering/protest/vigil/demonstration",

In order to avoid similar situations in the future, students suggested for the installation of cameras in the hallway or to have resident assistants conduct 24-hour watch on all floors.

”We wanted to remind the community that these acts of hate and discrimination not only create an environment of hostility but are a violation of university policy.” Amanda Chavez, the resident director of Peavine and Edtivia Rutherford, the graduate resident director of Peavine said in an email to Peavine residents. “We are a welcoming community that strives to embrace diversity and inclusion. We are made up of people from different backgrounds, races and ethnicities, religions, genders, sexual orientations, and abilities. All of us deserve the right to be treated with respect and live in an environment where we are not subject to discrimination. Read the linked article for more.

It says In response to the Peavine incident, ASUN held a town hall meeting on Wednesday, Nov. 7, 2018 to address student concerns. Around 100 students, faculty and concerned individuals attended the event. Topics of discussion included discrimination, sexual assault and Tau Kappa Epsilon. Some students condemned the university for not addressing antiSemitism properly and others felt the university did not support its Jewish students. In February 2019, President Hannah Jackson announced her partnership with Sigma Alpha Epsilon Pi sorority and Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity in order to create workshops to address antiSemitism on campus. ASUN, Student Services and Hillel plan to bring the Anti-defamation League of Nevada on campus for training. The Residence Hall Association held a town hall meeting in December 2018  to address students living in the resident halls’ concerns. Some students called for more transparency between housing and students since they were unsure if any action was being done. Students suggested more surveillance in the halls of student housing, increased security, more education on diversity and culture and stricter discipline on hate-crimes. Here, Associated Students of the University of Nevada announced they were planning a diversity and inclusion event for April 2019. RHA also advocated for residence halls’ Leadership Council to think of events or activities aimed at inclusion and diversity.",,school administration,gathering/protest/vigil/demonstration,police/sheriff,other,religious leaders,victim support,school administration,letters/statements,"gathering/protest/vigil/demonstration, other, victim support, letters/statements",

 The college then had to decide whether it would make any effort to alert the student body, staff and faculty to the incident. It was not a straightforward process.
 
 “The deliberations included us first being notified of the incident,” Dean of Multicultural Life Marjorie Trueblood said, “and then trying to determine would we publish or wouldn’t we publish, and was an email that was sent last year in the fall… the new protocol?”
 
 The email that Trueblood referred to was sent last Nov. 3 amidst a series of swastikas and other hate-related incidents on campus, and contained a message to students, faculty and staff from President Brian Rosenberg.
 
 “We didn’t have a lot of clarity in trying to figure that piece out,” she continued, “but decided that something had to happen and that students did need to be notified.”
 
 In it, Rosenberg wrote that, going forward, the college would “note and document” all hate markings and include them in publicly available security alerts, but not publish notices of them in the Mac Daily.
 
 “The challenge for us now,” Rosenberg wrote, “is finding the right balance between acknowledging the occurrence of these incidents and not encouraging more of them by giving the perpetrator or perpetrators what they so clearly want: attention.”
 
 In response to that decision and the proliferation of racist speech, political science professor Althea Sircar wrote an open letter published in The Mac Weekly calling for the college to engage in a “rigorous and sustained critique of and opposition to hateful words and actions.” Within a week, it received more than 600 signatures from students, staff and faculty. The Bias Response Team is a newly-formed group to deal with incidents of hate on campus, and consists of Trueblood, Collumbien, Assistant Vice President and Dean of Students DeMethra Bradley, Title IX and Bias Harassment Coordinator Timothy Dunn and College Chaplain and Associate Dean the Rev. Kelly Stone. The group met on Wednesday to talk about its processes and communication style going forward.

“My hope is that the Bias Response Team can formulate a process and a protocol that will be responsive to incidents of bias,” Trueblood said. “We can take into consideration what the email from last year stated, but we can also take into consideration what we’re hearing from our community members and figure out how to proceed.”

Trueblood said that the team, once it figures out what its protocol around hate-incidents will be, “definitely needs” to relay it to the campus at large. “Students are asking for more transparency,” Trueblood said. “That’s something to be mindful of – and I believe that we’re not any safer when we don’t know about these situations.”

Trueblood and Associate Chaplain for Jewish Life Rabbi Emma Kippley-Ogman led Tuesday night’s gathering, which included both testimony on the significance of the swastikas to students as well as discussion of how best to activate opposition to the symbols and other hate speech in the days and weeks ahead.

The meeting drew nearly 60 students and staff members – a significantly larger number than was expected, but still just a fraction of the total population of the college.

After its conclusion, many of those present placed some 200 blue pieces of paper with the words “You Belong Here” on desks throughout the library.",,school administration,gathering/protest/vigil/demonstration,school administration,policy/committee/system creation,religious leaders,gathering/protest/vigil/demonstration,student group,other,"gathering/protest/vigil/demonstration, policy/committee/system creation, gathering/protest/vigil/demonstration, other",

The meeting came less than 24 hours after parents received a letter from school officials telling them that racist bullying was on the rise at the school, 2250 N. Clifton Ave., and that they had contacted the Anti-Defamation League to help address the problem. Many of the parents questioned why they were not immediately contacted following the swastika incident, which happened Monday. Some of them learned about the incident through media reports, which they said was unacceptable.

But school administrators said they were in a difficult position. They wanted to first make sure the incident was isolated and had not happened on other students’ lockers. They stressed it was important to be decisive and intentional. “We will be working with [Mayer] to try to establish some sort of comprehensive plan or training for education,” Trubowitz said. “They’re really thinking about using this as an opportunity to not only instruct the student but the family members, administrators about the importance of addressing hate rhetoric, hate speech.”","one person recommended that day next week, all the students and staff wear the Star of David armbands like they did in Pittsburgh; not sure what happened; see note to pareents linked to in article",school administration,letters/statements,community members,gathering/protest/vigil/demonstration,school administration,policy/committee/system creation,,,"letters/statements, gathering/protest/vigil/demonstration, policy/committee/system creation",

Summit Mayor Nora Radest has weighed in with a statement that reads: “The recent drawings of swastikas and other offensive drawings found in the Summit Middle and High School are inexcusable. The immature and ignorant behavior is deplorable and will be addressed. I am confident that the school district, working in partnership with the Summit Police Department, will identify the individuals responsible for this activity. Most importantly, this terrible incident needs to serve as an opportunity for families and our schools to discuss the history of hate-symbols and how they will not be tolerated in Summit.

I firmly believe that this incident does not define us as a community; we are compassionate and respectful. We support one another and we must continue to stand up against hatred and bigotry wherever we see it.”  Since the symbols were discovered at the middle school and the public was subsequently informed by the Summit School District, the Hilltop City community has reacted with shock, sadness and resolve, handing out flyers at the middle school denouncing hate of any kind -- 'No Room For Hate' -- and taping the flyers on school lockers. Yard signs have also begun to spring up around neighborhoods with a similar message.

Summit parent Lisa Stein started both an online signup to let parents know that flyers would be distributed this morning at LCJSMS, and the Facebook group “No Room for Hate,” which is modeled after the Hate Has No Home Here organization. Yesterday, in response to the LCJSMS incident, Rabbi Avi Friedman made a public statement on the Summit Jewish Community page.  

He wrote, “Swastikas? Again?  When I see a red octagon, I stop.  The meaning of that symbol has been ingrained in me for as long as I can remember.  It does not have to have the word “stop” written on it. The symbol is enough to elicit a response.  It is one of many symbols that have that kind of power over me.

Another symbol which immediately elicits a response in me is the swastika – the emblem of Nazi Germany. Without saying a word, the presence of a swastika tells me that I am “other,” that I am hated and that I am in danger. It is not something I read in a book or saw in a movie that causes this response. It is the real-life experiences of family members. Like most other Jews my age, I grew up with relatives who had numbers tattooed on their arms. From an early age, I knew the stories of who got out of Europe when and who didn’t get out.  It was just a part of Jewish life.

So, when I heard – over a week after the fact – that swastikas had been graffitied on the wall of a bathroom in our local middle school, I had a visceral reaction that was out of my control. Now, to be clear, I don’t believe that there are Nazis here in Summit, New Jersey. Further, I don’t believe that our school district in any way condones the use of that symbol. That being said, I was underwhelmed by the response of our educational leaders.

Adolescents are supposed to test the boundaries of what is acceptable behavior and what is not.  That’s their job. The teen or teens who put those swastikas on the wall were experimenting. They wanted to see what kind of response that symbol would elicit. It’s the job of adults to make sure that those adolescents know when they’ve crossed a line.

Having an assembly with 12 components and making the response to the swastikas item #11 on the list is not exactly sending the message that this behavior is unacceptable in our community. And yet, that was the response of our school district. Further, parents were not notified about the assembly."" Grimaldi's message, in full, reads:

""Dear SHS Parents/Guardians, 

Please find the announcement I made this afternoon to all students regarding swastikas found at SHS. Please speak to your student about this issue, and let me know if you have any questions. 

Thank you, 
Stacy Grimaldi 
Principal 

This afternoon I was informed about the presence of several swastikas that were carved into two of the boys' bathroom stalls in the building. We have contacted the Summit Police Department and are working with them to find the perpetrator of these symbols of hatred. These acts of hatred and bigotry will not be tolerated at Summit High School. It is a priority of our school and district to create a safe and accepting learning environment for all students. Any act that violates this commitment will be swiftly and firmly addressed. 
If you know who did this or have any information about the source of this hatred, please see me as soon as possible. In addition, please report any acts of hatred to an administrator or teacher immediately. There is no room for hatred at Summit High School or in the Summit community.

Summit High School

Stacy Grimaldi""

Moments ago, an e-mail from Superintendent of Schools June Chang was sent out to District parents. It reads:

""Dear Parents/Guardians,

It saddens me to have to reach back out to you regarding another act of hatred. This afternoon we were notified of swastikas found in two of the boy’s bathrooms at the Summit High School. The discovery of these drawings came following conversations with students about ensuring our schools are safe places where everyone is welcome and valued. As a result of the conversations, a student reported the finding whereupon additional swastikas in the second bathroom were discovered. As we raise awareness about the power of these symbols and the impact of their meaning, we empower our students to come forward about such incidents and the harm they can inflict.

We feel it imperative that you remain aware of incidents like this as we continue to combat acts of hatred.

As stated in my November 29th letter to parents and guardians, “Acts of hate of any kind in the Summit Public Schools will not be tolerated. We take pride in our continual efforts to make the Summit Public Schools a safe and welcoming place for all of our students and staff. We value our diversity, and are serious about promoting kindness, acceptance, and understanding within our community.”

As was done at the middle school, all students at the high school were addressed, and were informed that hatred will not be tolerated or accepted. The Summit Police were contacted, and have been informed about these additional incidents. The police and school-wide investigation continues. Disciplinary action will be taken against any individual(s) involved in the incident.

I reiterate the importance of addressing this or any act of hatred ‘head-on’. Each of our schools continue to engage in conversations underscoring the importance of confronting hateful incidents, in addition to promoting appropriate behavior and actions that protect and support all of our students. Again, we encourage all Summit Schools families to engage with their children and neighbors in conversations about ending hatred and bigotry and promoting kindness and compassion.

I am pleased to report that excellent conversations about these incidents, and the need to combat hate, occurred today as part of the advisory program at the middle school. Hundreds of signs were hung on the walls and lockers at LCJSMS today stating simply that hate has no place in Summit. I am impressed by the sense of unity and the positive response of the LCJSMS staff and students. I am confident that the students and staff at Summit High School will also unite to stand against this type of behavior.

We continue to work with the Summit Police Department, our guidance counselors, and staff to create an environment that is accepting of ALL students, and will continue to enhance our role in delivering those positive messages to the students and staff of the Summit Public Schools.

Thank you.

Sincerely,

June Chang Superintendent of Schools""",,school administration,letters/statements,community members,gathering/protest/vigil/demonstration,police/sheriff,other,school administration,policy/committee/system creation,"letters/statements, gathering/protest/vigil/demonstration, other, policy/committee/system creation",

We are confident that this swastika was recently created. Students alerted administration to the presence of the symbol in a library bathroom. For further detail, I have attached the notice sent by Dr. Siciliano. In my January 24th letter to the community, in which I provided information about how the school district is responding to the repeated instances of swastikas on school property, I said that I would soon provide an opportunity for dialogue. I am now extending that invitation to any and all members of our community who would like to join us in discussion. On Thursday, February 16th at 7:30 pm, we will provide a forum in the John Jay High School cafeteria. While there are steps that schools take to help students understand the meaning and impact of their actions, the work of inspiring empathy and combating hatred is work for a collective, connected community. My intention for our meeting on the 16th is to provide a space for dialogue, for the sharing of concerns and hopes, and for thinking together about moving forward. I hope this will be an opportunity for us to consider the many ways we inspire respect, empathy, and compassion, and I hope you will consider joining us. Sincerely, Andrew Selesnick February 8, 2017 Dear JJHS Community, With a deep sense of sadness, I must report another incident of a swastika at JJHS. This morning, students alerted administration to a swastika in a library bathroom. Once again, the police were notified immediately and have commenced their investigation. Once again, we must condemn the appearance of this hateful symbol in our school and continue the work that has already begun. A number of students have already exercised real leadership by planning events and programs to respond positively to prior incidents of antisemitic-graffiti on campus and in the community. These plans include inviting Mrs. Judith Altmann, who is a Holocaust survivor, to speak to all of us later this month. We are also in contact with the Anti-Defamation League about possible programming for the future. Later today, Mr. Selesnick will be sending a letter to the entire community, inviting all to an open forum next Thursday, February 16th. When similar events happen in succession, we must consider the possibility that the root cause may be a misplaced need for attention and weigh our response accordingly. While certain responses are predictable (calling the police, condemning the act), other responses will vary. Please know that we are giving considerable thought and attention as to the best path forward for all our students. We continue to ask for the assistance and support of the student body and community. We are extremely grateful that students came to us immediately today. If anyone else has information related to this most recent act, please contact an administrator or the Lewisboro Police immediately. Be assured that we will continue working with our students, community, and police to help put a stop to these most disturbing acts. Thank you for your continued cooperation and assistance.

Another speaker, a young man of color, talked about experiencing racism and being “jumped”, she said. ADL got involved. Of the 28 students in the chat, 12 received a “disciplinary consequence” due to their participation in the texts or involvement in the swastika incident, the superintendent, Andy Cantwell, said in an email Tuesday.","The middle school in Ojai, a small city 80 miles north-west of Los Angeles, told parents in a letter in December that officials had discovered photos showing “nine students laying on the field together to form the shape of a swastika during lunch”.

“These symbols of hate have no place in our society and especially within our schools. This behavior is deeply offensive and will not be tolerated,” the letter read.
In the letter, they said that as an “immediate response,” all students attended an assembly where the principal and assistant principal  “discussed the swastika's meaning, its dark place in our history and why the symbol remains offensive to this day.”
Following the incident, US Congressman Eliot Engel issued a statement.
“The appearance of this despicable symbol is yet another example of the rising tide of antisemitism in our country,” Engel wrote.
“Children in school should never be subjected to hate, racism, or intolerance of any kind.  All of us in the public space have a moral responsibility to make sure our words and actions are combating this hate, not fueling the fire.""

Although the incident was thoroughly investigated, we were unable to determine who was responsible,” Principal Shelley Somers said in a letter to parents.“While we have taken steps to educate our students about the impact of symbols and language of hate, this latest disheartening incident of antisemitic propaganda cannot be tolerated,” she said.

Somers said the school has addressed intolerance through “Advisory classes, social emotional learning lessons, and our revised Social Studies curriculum, and will continue with a Nov. 7 grade level ‘Step Up’ assembly coordinated by the Anti-Defamation League.”

However, Somers said these steps have not been enough, and is now planning a parent meeting, including clergy and community members, to “discuss strategies to eliminate this unacceptable behavior. You can expect an email from me confirming the date and the time.”

“My staff and I have worked hard for the past three years to develop a climate of kindness at Middlesex.

Dear WMS Community,

It is with deep concern that I share with you that a swastika was found in one of the boys’ bathrooms at the middle school in the evening hours, late last week.  As we continue to investigate, we are unsure of who drew it, but we do feel it was done after school hours when the building was open for evening activities.  Regardless, this act of antiSemitism is something that will not be tolerated in our school and district.  As the building leader, I feel that any act that does not support our values of inclusivity and safety for all, will be strongly addressed by our WPS/WMS administration.  

In response, we will continue to discuss strategies with our community partners from Temple Beth Elohim, consider the timing of our antisemitic curriculum delivered in social studies classes, think of potential educational opportunities from the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), and monitor our building for safety.  I also plan to communicate a message to all students in our school that expresses my concerns and thoughts about antisemitic and racist acts.  We are a caring community at WMS, and I want everyone to be responsible for our feelings of safety and respect that need to be practiced daily.

If you have any information that you feel is important for our school to know, please contact me or one of our assistant principals directly.  Additionally, I hope that you will talk to your children about the incident, as it involves all of us.  As a school, we feel such sorrow and remorse when antisemitic incidents happen, as we work tirelessly to try and prevent them.  That being said, I feel confident in our ability to address — reactively and proactively – those things that negatively impede our school days and greater lives.  We continue to strive for safety for all students at WMS.

Sincerely,

Mark Ito
Principal, Wellesley Middle School             Dear Members of the Wellesley Community,

As we continue to hold diversity, equity, and inclusion as high priorities in the Wellesley Public Schools, we have recently been reminded of the challenges we face in pursuit of these values. Following an athletic competition last week, a WHS athlete was called a racial slur by an athlete from a neighboring community. At the end of the week, we discovered a swastika drawn in a bathroom at Wellesley Middle School. The District has reported both of these incidents to the Wellesley Police Department and the Anti-Defamation League.

Let me be clear that any actions involving language and/or symbols of hate are unacceptable and will not be tolerated in our District.  Each of these incidents also underscores the importance of our continued efforts to ensure that our school community remains a safe and inclusive place for all of our students and staff.

When hate is allowed to grow unchecked, it can lead to tragic consequences. Just one year ago yesterday, a gunman took the lives of eleven worshippers at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. We are clearly not immune from the issues of hate and division that are on the rise in our country.  As we engage with each other and our young people, I ask that all members of our community speak with one, unambiguous voice in support of our core values of Respect for Human Differences, Cooperative and Caring Relationships, and Commitment to Community. 

Thank you,

David F. Lussier, Ed.D.

Ginter addressed the incident on March 3 in his “Principal’s Message” on the school’s website without sending a message directly to Rio families.  Word about the swastika began to spread. Dana Kurzrock, a Jewish parent of a Rio student, met with Ginter and helped to organize the March 10 meeting, which lasted more than two hours.

In her opening remarks, Kurzrock said she had discussed the swastika incident not only with Ginter but with vice principals, the Safe Schools office, the local Jewish Community Relations Council, rabbis, the Jewish Federation in Sacramento, the Anti-Defamation League and the FBI.

We concluded that they were written on the posters after the end of the school day the day before because there were no eyewitnesses, nobody who noticed it.”

Freeman then put the posters in her desk and, after three weeks with no further signs of disturbance surrounding the issue, eventually recycled them. Members of the JSU and the Cleveland Alliance for Racial Equity (CARE) were invited to speak on a panel at the December staff meeting about the posters and how to address antiSemitism in classrooms. JSU leaders also visited history classrooms delivering presentations about the situation, antiSemitism, and steps the students could take to prevent hate speech.  There are currently events and ideas in the works about combating hate speech and creating a safe and communicative environment at Cleveland. Vice Principal Kristy Mize hopes to plan an event including all racial affinity and sexual orientation clubs, to broadcast their voice and work collaboratively to combat hate speech heard in the hallways.

Beginning in January, Principal Freeman will be holding parent listening sessions once a month for parents and guardians to attend. Additionally, the ninth grade academy Wy’East will be taking a field trip to the Portland Art Museum exhibit of Holocaust photographs, “Memory Unearthed.” “It’s part of the work that we do as school administrators,” said Freeman. “A big part of our job is of course to teach young people how to communicate with kindness and compassion.”

Members of the JSU highlight the importance of continued involvement. “This isn’t the end of our efforts with administration and making change. We’re still going to keep working on this continuously, and if people want to get involved, then come to JSU and talk to us,” said Birk-Stachon.

I am writing this post to say I am truly sorry for the insensitive prank which my friends and I participated in during the holiday season last December. What we did was reckless, stupid, idiotic, and insensitive. From the bottom of my heart I apologize to your family. From the bottom of my heart I can tell you that that is not the way of my Jamaican heritage. My Jamaican West Indian extended family are strict disciplinarians who have always taught me to embrace diversity and cultural differences. They taught me to be respectful to all no matter what the circumstances are. Before my dad and I moved to Arizona seven years ago, we lived in a town called Queens in New York City where I was born. While I lived in New York I got to interact with many different cultures and people. I embrace that teaching and that has helped me to develop friendship with a diverse group of people. I have friends from many different backgrounds and cultures. Last December during the holiday season I made a mistake when I joined my friends in a very insensitive prank. If I could turn back the clock and remove myself and my three friends from participating in the horrible prank I would. But I canâ€™t. My dad said that if there is a silver lining in this very dark cloud it is that I have become much more aware of the Jewish culture and I now have a better understanding of the Menorah and what it means. Over the last couple of days my dad who attended the Jewish-based Brandeis University in Boston gave me a text book lesson on the Jewish culture and what Judaism is. To the family affected by the horrible prank I once again express regret and ask you to forgive me. I ask you for a second chance and for the opportunity to complete my college education and get a chance to live a better life and be a good citizen.

The swastika once represented Nazi Germany and still symbolizes hate today.

Gonzalez's home wasn't the only one to be vandalized. The hate-symbol appeared at least a dozen times along Pacific Avenue from 17th Street to 19th Street. 

""It's all the way down from the beginning of this alley point to the street down at the end of the alley point. That's what it was and it's just terrible to have it the way it is,"" Gonzalez said. 

Police are investigating the incident as a hate-crime and are actively looking for who's responsible.

""It's ugly. It's disgusting and we need to do something about it,"" said Gonzalez. ""It's ugly. It's disgusting and we need to do something about it,"" said Gonzalez. 

Lion Lyons agrees with her. He's a community activist who will be holding a special meeting about the vandalism. 

""Hopefully we can get someone to come forward and put all the guys, who did all this mess, put them to justice,"" said Lyons.

Gonzalez has never seen anything like this and is disappointed in the people who did it.

""God created everyone all equal and we should be able to be nice to each other, happy, content, and just avoid this stupidity,"" she said.

“I’m very glad that we are all making a statement that the vast majority of us believe that this is disgusting,” senior Sam Quattrociocchi said during lunch. “Some people at the party thought they were making an edgy joke, and they were completely wrong.”     Newport Harbor Principal Sean Boulton said in a statement that Monday’s community meeting at the school was to include him, Costa Mesa High Principal Jacob Haley, Estancia High Principal Michael Halt and Rabbi Reuven Mintz of the Chabad Center for Jewish Life.

“The goal of the event is to start a significant conversation to take us to a place where this sort of behavior never happens again in our community,” Boulton said. “Over the past few years, all Newport-Mesa schools have worked tirelessly to eliminate prejudice, hate and bullying and continually work toward true tolerance and equality. We are obviously not there yet, but the journey continues.

“Diversity is the backbone of our schools, but in this social and social media climate, we are subject to hate, offensive acts/language and religious intolerance.

The Newport-Mesa Unified School District Board approved the creation of a human relations task force March 12 in response to recent acts of antiSemitism involving students from Newport Harbor High School, said Adriana Angulo, a school district spokeswoman.  

“The Task Force will help determine the best course of action to help educate not only our students but also our parents, teachers and the broader community as we work together to fight all forms of hate,” Angulo wrote in an email on May 13 to The Panther. see here for more on task force: https://www.thepantheronline.com/news/school-district-creates-task-force-after-swastika-incident-antisemitic-flyers-posted-at-newport-beach-high-school","See this article for how swastika has become trendy with kids on social media as well as games like ""holocaust pong"": https://forward.com/news/420614/its-not-your-imagination-the-nazi-swastika-is-trendy-among-teens/",school administration,gathering/protest/vigil/demonstration,school administration,policy/committee/system creation,student group,gathering/protest/vigil/demonstration,,,"gathering/protest/vigil/demonstration, policy/committee/system creation, gathering/protest/vigil/demonstration",
