Text of letter: Dear UIndy Students: Respect, faith, empiricism, and the celebration of intellectual and human diversity create the core traditions of the University of Indianapolis. During the past three years, our community has discussed the themes of race and ethnicity, religious freedom and liberties, social justice and human rights – areas profoundly impacting our nation and most recently, the public policies of our state. As our colleagues at Purdue, IU, Cornell, University of Missouri, Yale, and many other institutions around the country engage these questions, we are all reminded how these debates are central to understanding the role that higher education plays in the construction of a civil and educated society. I am proud of our tradition of respectfully and openly engaging in discussions about the most critical issues of our time. We have engaged questions of same-sex marriage, our students recently debated the questions of the Israeli and Palestinian conflict and human rights, and we have been in ongoing conversations about race and culture with all of our members. In direct contrast to our efforts to celebrate our diversity, I was recently made aware that someone scratched a swastika on the bust of Au Ho-nien, located in Schwitzer Student Center. The incident is currently under investigation. Such an act is against every core value on which our University stands; yet it reminds us we are not immune to intolerance and hate. UIndy has not and will never tolerate such behavior. Our University community is created by and comprised of people from many different views, experiences, cultures and beliefs. We are a great institution of higher education because of our diversity – and must do everything we can to continue to value this reality. Later this week I will receive the outcomes of our second campus climate survey as well as recommendations from the Diversity and Inclusion Task Force. For the past six months, I have also been in conversations with our University Planning Commission and student groups around campus. Having been privileged to see a preview of these findings, I am empowering our university leadership to accelerate the implementation of many of the recommendations from these groups – most prominently, the creation of a position at UIndy to engage questions of diversity and inclusion on campus. I am proud of our University’s longstanding tradition of engaging conversations about difficult societal issues and creating change. This is a moment for UIndy to continue its work in this area, and I am confident that together we are prepared for this challenge.",,school administration,letters/statements,"school administration

“The online cyber bullying that has been allowed by the administrators on ‘Nassau County Rants and Raves’ has fueled the hate speech’ that my opponent and her operatives have approved.

“There has been a lot of media attention and public outrage concerning the graffiti incident which was reported yesterday in the Village of Wellsville. First, I would like to set the record straight regarding the police department’s reported response. This incident occurred on private property and was reported to the police by a local media outlet. Upon the officer’s response, the initial focus was to determine who owned the property so that we could establish a complainant. Once that was completed we worked with the property owners to ensure the graffiti would be promptly painted over.
“I would like to thank the volunteers who quickly responded to ensure that this was done. The graffiti was certainly concerning, biased and racially charged, but we have not developed a specific target. The department is actively investigating the incident and will charge anyone responsible. There are no suspects at this time and we are asking that anyone who may have observed suspicious activity in that area during the overnight hours of Monday into Tuesday morning to please contact the police department at (585) 593-5600.
“At this time, it appears that this is an isolated incident. In no way does this act represent the sentiments of the Wellsville residents and it will not be condoned. In my opinion, the incident has received more media attention that it deserved, which is exactly what the vandal wanted."" Graffiti was painted over.",Happened sometime the night of November 7th or early morning November 8th.,police/sheriff,other,"police/sheriff

The one element of those opening remarks that remains unchanged from one fall to the next is an unwavering affirmation, “Who comes here belongs here.” If ever there was a time for William & Mary to re-affirm that foundational claim in both words and actions, now is that time.  Each one of you belongs here – you were specially chosen to be a part of this campus community, and you are of immeasurable worth because of the diverse experiences, perspectives, identities, traditions, affiliations, and abilities you bring with you. What can never belong here at W&M are any behaviors that harass, intimidate, or threaten others.  It grieves me to know that students in our community are witnessing or directly experiencing such behaviors, as well as the accompanying pain, confusion, and fear they engender. Since last week’s presidential election, students have shared with us, both anonymously and through more formal channels, information about such threats and harassment. Just yesterday, we received a disturbing report about graffiti written on a paper towel dispenser in a hall bathroom in a residence hall. An image of the graffiti, which included the words “Go Trump” with a swastika substituting for the “T” has been widely circulated on social media. No one has come forward to claim responsibility or motive, and we encourage anyone with information about the incident to contact William & Mary Police at 221-4596. Yesterday afternoon, students, faculty and administrators gathered in Tucker Hall to talk about the climate on campus, to ask questions, and to support one another during this turbulent time.  A number of you asked for more information about our campus policies, avenues for reporting discrimination and harassment, and a list of campus resources.  I hope this specially-designed website is helpful – please reach out and let us know what else you might need.  The university will follow-up on reports to the best of our ability using the information provided.  Above all, leverage the trusting relationships you have established at William & Mary with faculty members, with administrators, with mentors, and with your friends. And may we each commit to listening more, with compassion and with respect.

The Rev. Boroughs’ message further condemned the act, calling it a hate crime. “Words, symbols, and actions, used to hurt and question another human’s right to exist, hold a power that cannot be underestimated,” Rev. Boroughs said in the statement. He said the rhetoric of the last year, which has continued past the presidential election, “has given rise to a feeling among some in our country that they have permission to carry out targeted hate crimes, denigrate the rights of others based on their race, gender, sexual identity, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, citizenship status and candidate they supported in the presidential election.” He said that permission has not been granted on the Holy Cross campus. He said he’s still trying to determine how to stand firmly against the new climate, but added that it’s clear this is not a time to be passive or indifferent. He suggested ways the community can become involved, and noted that just this week he joined presidents from more than 100 colleges and universities across the U.S. in signing a letter to President-elect Donald Trump committing to the promotion of equal rights and freedom from discrimination on college campuses. The letter went on to urge him to condemn harassment, hate, and acts of violence. Rev. Boroughs said it’s also important in the wake of such incidents that occurred Thursday to be cognizant of if a neighbor is hurting, feeling scared, or afraid for their family. “Reach out,” he said. “Seek out conversations with others who might think differently. Listen to diverse perspectives, and strive to understand and respect even when you don’t agree.”",,school administration,clean up/cover up,"school administration

The discovery of graffiti in books about Islam is troubling. Free speech is one thing; defacing sacred texts and books about religion is quite another. Those who are caught defacing library materials will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.

Our partnership with Northwestern’s Middle East and North African Studies (MENA) program is an excellent example of bringing informative programs to our public library.

We are committed to ensuring that our school is a safe environment for each and every student and staff member, and to valuing and honoring and our commonalities and our differences.
Sadly, we recently discovered a swastika drawn in a stall in one of our student restrooms. We are deeply concerned that one or more of our students would find this offensive, insensitive and divisive symbol to be funny or acceptable.
As soon as we discovered it, our maintenance team immediately removed the offensive drawing and restored the restroom facility to its original condition. We also began an investigation, but have not yet identified who defaced the bathroom.  Please know that though we have not identified the students involved, we are already taking steps to address what happened.
We see this as an important teachable moment, which demonstrates our need to reinforce tolerance in our community, and are taking the following actions:
In every Social Studies class today, teachers facilitated discussions to help students understand their civic – and community – responsibility to welcome each other; to support the goals that we all have for education, personal growth, and warm relationships; and to discuss how we can address these issues in our own school environment.
We are reminding our students, staff, faculty and families that we are an inclusive educational community and have zero tolerance for racially, ethnically or other types of insensitive behaviors.
We are reminding students that bias incidents are a violation of the Code of Conduct and are subject to disciplinary action according to the SOMSD Discipline Policy.
We will be using our advisory period for continuing conversations about tolerance and individual responsibility for fostering unity in our school.
We ask for the partnership and support of our parents and guardians in talking with your children about the important role each of us has in making sure our school is a safe environment, where each student feels respected and included. These two links to resources have been shared with staff, and you may find them useful tools for conversations at home:

James Reifschneider, a spokesman for the Palo Alto Police Department. The swastikas drawn were more similar to the symbol for peace commonly associated with Buddhism and Hinduism, he said. “We’re assuming that our vandal was misinformed and was a bit lazy in drawing his graffiti,” Reifschneider said. “We believe he intended to make an antisemitic reference as opposed to a Buddhist reference.” The swastikas appeared on signs of two law firms on Page Mill Road, as well as city signs at three intersections along Stanford Avenue, said Reifschneider. Another swastika was discovered on a grocery store in downtown Palo Alto a few miles away on Friday. Little to no property damage was caused, Reifschneider said. The swastikas were drawn no larger than a basketball, and the black grease pen used by the vandal or vandals can be wiped off, Reifschneider said. Though the vandalism was “of a relatively minor nature,” Reifschneider said, hate-crime related graffiti is rare for the area, happening just a few times a year. It’s also unusual for so many vandalism incidents to be clustered together in the same are during the same time, he said.

On behalf of the District, I extend our appreciation both to the State Police and Lewisboro Police for their swift and effective work. While the media reported the arrests of three juveniles, we can confirm that the three are students in our schools. We are now working with these students and their families. As I wrote in my original email on this topic, we will never accept the appearance of symbols of hate in our schools. We will continue to educate all our students on the importance of tolerance, acceptance, and compassion. Behavior that is hurtful to others has no place in our school community. Some may want to ask what consequences the District provides for students who commit such acts. Specific consequences, however, that are given to individual students remain confidential. The community can be assured that such matters are taken very seriously. Within the last few days, school principals and I met with local religious leaders to discuss how we can best work together to support the students and the community we collectively serve. We plan to keep these lines of communication open moving forward. As always, my thanks to our community for your support. Sincerely, Andrew Selesnick Superintendent of Schools",,school administration,letters/statements,"school administration

“It would be premature for me to assume that,” said Lt. Chris Garrett, the public information officer for Henrico police. “If it rose to that nature, we would investigate it that way.” He said repairs are expected to be finished early next week with most of the graffiti already gone by mid-afternoon Thursday.  Brydon DeWitt, the president of Tuckahoe Little League, said officials were “shocked and terribly upset” by the vandalism.

“Almost everything has already been restored to get back to where it needs to be,” he said Thursday. “Such terrible graffiti is bad enough in and of itself, but to be inflicted on our little league park is horrifying.

“We don’t think it’s the actions of a hate group and is just some kids tying to write the worst possible things they can think of.

I am writing this post to say I am truly sorry for the insensitive prank which my friends and I participated in during the holiday season last December. What we did was reckless, stupid, idiotic, and insensitive. From the bottom of my heart I apologize to your family. From the bottom of my heart I can tell you that that is not the way of my Jamaican heritage. My Jamaican West Indian extended family are strict disciplinarians who have always taught me to embrace diversity and cultural differences. They taught me to be respectful to all no matter what the circumstances are. Before my dad and I moved to Arizona seven years ago, we lived in a town called Queens in New York City where I was born. While I lived in New York I got to interact with many different cultures and people. I embrace that teaching and that has helped me to develop friendship with a diverse group of people. I have friends from many different backgrounds and cultures. Last December during the holiday season I made a mistake when I joined my friends in a very insensitive prank. If I could turn back the clock and remove myself and my three friends from participating in the horrible prank I would. But I canâ€™t. My dad said that if there is a silver lining in this very dark cloud it is that I have become much more aware of the Jewish culture and I now have a better understanding of the Menorah and what it means. Over the last couple of days my dad who attended the Jewish-based Brandeis University in Boston gave me a text book lesson on the Jewish culture and what Judaism is. To the family affected by the horrible prank I once again express regret and ask you to forgive me. I ask you for a second chance and for the opportunity to complete my college education and get a chance to live a better life and be a good citizen. Clive (CJ) Wilson Police helped Naomi and Seth Ellis dismantle the swastika early in the morning before the Ellis children saw it. The menorah was rebuilt and replaced. About 100 members of the family’s synagogue and their rabbi and neighbors gathered in the Ellis front yard to light the rebuilt menorah. They were sentenced to serve 30 hours of community service, along with writing an apology letter to the victims and paying restitution. They also must meet with a Holocaust survivor and write an essay on what they learn about the Holocaust and how their desecration of the menorah affected the community, the CBS affiliate in Phoenix reported.

 KLSD reaffirms a climate of acceptance and inclusion for all
 Swastikas were discovered carved into a tree on the John Jay High School campus yesterday afternoon, just three weeks after a swastika was found on the playground of Lewisboro Elementary School.
 Lewisboro Police were immediately contacted and an investigation has begun by both the police and the high school administration. The State and Lewisboro Police have apprehended three students in conjunction with the graffiti at Lewisboro Elementary.
 “As a District, we are saddened and angered by the appearance of symbols of hatred in our community,” said Katonah-Lewisboro Superintendent Andrew Selesnick. “When events such as these occur, it is important first and foremost to shine a light immediately on what has occurred, to name it, and to condemn it.”
 Selesnick said the high school principal called students and staff together Friday morning to convey that same message, to assure that such behavior is not, and never will be, acceptable in the community, and to begin thinking about the most productive ways to move forward.
 “As an educational institution, we are always working to teach our students the lessons of history. We are always working to convey the expectation and the need for acceptance, compassion, and respect,” Selesnick said. “The events of the last few weeks cause us to reflect on where and how we can strengthen the work we are already doing. We have reached out to organizations outside the school because this work does not and should not belong to the schools alone. It is critical that we commit ourselves to educating and raising children as a community. These events serve as a reminder of the importance of our partnership.”
 Superintendent Selesnick declined to name the students apprehended in the first swastika incident, citing the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). FERPA prohibits the release of student records, including disciplinary records, without the consent of the student’s parent. He added, however, that the district’s Code of Conduct spells out a range of consequences up to suspension from school.
 “We are entrusted with the community’s children, and we take that responsibility seriously. Children are here to learn and sometimes their most challenging lessons occur outside the classroom,” Selesnick said.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------January 20, 2017
 Dear JJHS Community,
 This message is a follow up after informing the community of antisemitic-graffiti found on the high school campus yesterday.
 First thing this morning, I called together our 9th and 10th graders, and our 11th and 12th graders, in two separate assemblies in order to speak with them in person about recent events. It is my hope that all of our families reflect on the day’s assemblies with their children this evening and assist us in our ongoing work.
 As part of the assemblies, students were informed about the discovery of swastikas on school grounds yesterday. A discussion about the pain such symbols of hate create for individuals and the community ensued. I’m gratified but not surprised to report our students knew exactly why such symbols have no place in our community. In addition to discussing why such acts are painful and intolerable everywhere in the Katonah-Lewisboro Schools and our society, we also focused on how our students have the agency, guidance, and support to turn this pain into a truer representation of who we are and what we stand for.
 The recently celebrated birthday of the late Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., gave us all context to explore his words of how only light can drive out darkness. His prophetic words also challenged all of us at the high school to find avenues to “turn on the light,” and we will work to do so.
 Our student body (and especially our student leaders) were called upon to partner with their peers, teachers, and administrators, to find ways to consciously and intentionally express and affirm our desire to be a culture where all are valued, respected, and belong.
 Thank you for your continued support in keeping all of our students safe and whole.
 Sincerely,
 Dr. Steven T. Siciliano""",Also reported here: https://www.lohud.com/story/news/crime/2017/01/19/swastikas-john-jay-high/96809444/,school administration,letters/statements,"school administration

Godwin explained that the graffiti and additional acts of intolerance are not entirely uncommon to occur on campus, but this pattern that has occurred is out of the ordinary. According to Godwin, Student Affairs addressed the act of intolerance by sending the campus-wide email. The USD administration also encouraged the community to report further information and incidents. Additionally, Student Affairs hosts events to educate the USD community through programs that promote diversity and inclusivity. Terrence Shaw is the community director for Camino and Founders. Shaw was alerted about the incident on Tuesday, two days before the USD community received the email from Godwin.

""Ms. Kaicher actually is shocked, disturbed and distressed on a daily basis by the affront to civility of the display of the Swastika on the Schilling property,"" alleges the lawsuit.

Rochester attorney Jeffrey Wicks, who represents Kaicher and spoke on her behalf, said the ugly power of the swastika can't be ignored, especially after the 2017 march by neo-Nazis and white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia, that led to a homicide and after the mass shooting of 11 attendees at a Jewish synagogue in Pittsburgh in October.                                                          another neighbor started GoFundMe page to help them build a fence to block the view. When asked about the flags, the neighbor said: “They’re history flags…and if someone is afraid to remember history, that’s their problem. History should not be forgotten and as far as that offending him, why should it?” Also says: Schilling contends that his flags, regardless of their history, are ""protected under the First Amendment."" Wicks differed, noting that the constitutional protection is a limitation on what the government can do to impede speech.

We are confident that this swastika was recently created. Students alerted administration to the presence of the symbol in a library bathroom. For further detail, I have attached the notice sent by Dr. Siciliano. In my January 24th letter to the community, in which I provided information about how the school district is responding to the repeated instances of swastikas on school property, I said that I would soon provide an opportunity for dialogue. I am now extending that invitation to any and all members of our community who would like to join us in discussion. On Thursday, February 16th at 7:30 pm, we will provide a forum in the John Jay High School cafeteria. While there are steps that schools take to help students understand the meaning and impact of their actions, the work of inspiring empathy and combating hatred is work for a collective, connected community. My intention for our meeting on the 16th is to provide a space for dialogue, for the sharing of concerns and hopes, and for thinking together about moving forward. I hope this will be an opportunity for us to consider the many ways we inspire respect, empathy, and compassion, and I hope you will consider joining us. Sincerely, Andrew Selesnick February 8, 2017 Dear JJHS Community, With a deep sense of sadness, I must report another incident of a swastika at JJHS. This morning, students alerted administration to a swastika in a library bathroom. Once again, the police were notified immediately and have commenced their investigation. Once again, we must condemn the appearance of this hateful symbol in our school and continue the work that has already begun. A number of students have already exercised real leadership by planning events and programs to respond positively to prior incidents of antisemitic-graffiti on campus and in the community. These plans include inviting Mrs. Judith Altmann, who is a Holocaust survivor, to speak to all of us later this month. We are also in contact with the Anti-Defamation League about possible programming for the future. Later today, Mr. Selesnick will be sending a letter to the entire community, inviting all to an open forum next Thursday, February 16th. When similar events happen in succession, we must consider the possibility that the root cause may be a misplaced need for attention and weigh our response accordingly. While certain responses are predictable (calling the police, condemning the act), other responses will vary. Please know that we are giving considerable thought and attention as to the best path forward for all our students. We continue to ask for the assistance and support of the student body and community. We are extremely grateful that students came to us immediately today. If anyone else has information related to this most recent act, please contact an administrator or the Lewisboro Police immediately. Be assured that we will continue working with our students, community, and police to help put a stop to these most disturbing acts. Thank you for your continued cooperation and assistance.

Howard Gray and Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson informed the university community about the incidents in an email Wednesday. Georgetown University Student Association Vice President Jessica Andino (COL ’18) said GUSA is concerned by any bias-related incident. “We are deeply concerned by the swastika sign and other bias-related incidents that have recently come to light,” Andino wrote in an email to The Hoya. “GUSA stands by any Hoyas that have been personally attacked through these hate-incidents, whether it be a member of the Jewish, Muslim, Black, Hindu, Latinx, or LGBTQ community.” Andino and Mack plan to meet with Gruber tonight to discuss how to improve student safety and prevent future vandalism. Director for Jewish Life Rabbi Rachel Gartner condemned the incidents. “Cowardly expressions of hate like the ones we’ve been seeing deserve no less than our disdain, condemnation, and investigation,” Gartner wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I am proud of how seriously and expertly the university has been handling them, and how sensitively university staff and officials have been reaching out to those targeted. And my heart is warmed and encouraged by the ways students are reaching out to one another as well.”",Also mentioned in this article was the ripping down and vandalization of Muslim and Hindu flyers from chaplain-in-residence bulletin boards.,school administration,clean up/cover up,"school administration

In instances like this, we work with children so that they understand some very important messages -expressions of hate or attempts to instill fear have not place in our schools. Everyone belongs; everyone is welcome; and everyone deserves to feel safe and respected in our schools. As educators, we need to teach children what some words and symbols mean and how those words and symbols make other people feel. In our schools, students are members of an inclusive community that values respectful and responsible relationships. We need to teach students very explicitly and intentionally exactly what that means. Please let me know if you have any other questions, Jennifer Fischer-Mueller, Ed.D. Superintendent of Schools Here's the letter sent home from the principal: March 23, 2017 Dear Galvin Parents/Guardians and Staff: Wednesday afternoon, two Swastikas were found in the 3rd floor of the boys' bathroom by an after-school custodian. This incident is extremely disturbing and against our school values of creating a welcoming, safe, and inclusive community at the Galvin Middle School. I want to assure the Galvin community that this incident, and any incident of intolerance to others, is taken very seriously. Galvin administrators, along with our School Resource Officer, are investigating this incident. Our guidance staff, along with school officials, will be available to offer support to students. In addition, over the coming days, our student body will have an opportunity to think about the important nature and implications of this type of incident in discussions they will have with some of their teachers. We will continue to educate and support your children so to insure that everyone is striving to create and sustain respectful and responsible relationships for all. If you have any questions or would like to speak with me directly, please contact me at conardw@cantonma.org or 781-821-5070 X3103.

In a classroom environment where there are fewer opportunities for students to think about, share ideas, develop opinions, and listen to each other, the bathroom suddenly became a breeding ground for fermented thoughts, and a place to really push the envelope. I donâ€™t think that the person who drew the swastika was an antisemite, I think that he wanted to trigger the administration....Looking forward, the answer to this problem is not more safe spaces and heightened political correctness. The answer is letting the student body develop a thicker skin, reforming the student culture so we can create a learning environment that allows people to speak freely and ask the questions that we want to ask so that these feelings of frustration can be channeled through civil discourse instead of inflammatory drawings on the bathroom wall.
 
 I think that one way we can get to this point is by having more student organized events, like town halls, where students can voice their concerns without the faculty breathing down their necks.

I am here to say that while hate may live in the hearts of some in our Community, we give it no shelter and no safe harbor. I call on New Milford to come together to not only denounce this expression of hate, but to beat it back into the furthest recesses of the twisted heart that harbors it,” he wrote in part.

The latter happened, leaving a nearly empty support section, which is an unusual sight for a Rising FC match. Afterward, Rising FC issued a statement saying the banner was asked to be removed “in order to comply with United Soccer League stadium regulations and Phoenix Rising Football Club safety policies.” The statement also said, “Phoenix Rising FC did not intend for our friends from Los Bandidos to leave our stadium, and apologize if our communications during the match did not properly demonstrate our respect and appreciation for its members. In fact, Phoenix Rising FC fully and unequivocally, supports the ‘Stop Racism’ sentiment of the banner and believes all people should be treated equally and with love. According to United Soccer League stadium guidelines, “All banners and signs must be inspected by security as fans enter the stadium, at least 30 minutes before kickoff. The club has the right to deny any banner’s display in the venue. Any sign or tifo deemed offensive, explicit, racist, homophobic or in bad taste will not be permitted in the venue.” In a Facebook post, Los Bandidos wrote, “We were never on bad terms with the ownership or (front office) ,we had a good standing with them before and now through direct discussion with the club- it’s brought us even closer.

The students then removed all the paint from the door. The student who painted the swastika reported to campus authorities what they had done. The college has begun disciplinary proceedings, and the student will be held accountable under our campus code of conduct. In addition, we will continue speaking directly with the students who were involved or immediately affected in the dorm where the painting occurred. None of the people directly involved felt targeted as a function of their identity. For that reason we instigated our investigation and conduct processes without initially making a larger campus announcement. However, several JAs have reported that other students who heard partial accounts of the incident were concerned, especially in the aftermath of Charlottesville and other troubling events. Understanding their concerns, we want you to have full information about what happened and know what steps are being taken, and to assure you that we have no basis for thinking the incident points to an ongoing threat. Defacing our campus is unacceptable at any time. But the use of a swastika, even as a “prank,” shows a lack of sensitivity to how that symbol has been used as a weapon of intimidation and hatred, both historically and in recent incidents around the country. If you want support, or if you have questions, please contact the Dean’s Office, the Office of Institutional Diversity & Equity our Chaplains, the Davis Center or Wellbeing Services. And if you have experienced an incident of bias or are aware of one, please report it immediately so the college can step in.",,school administration,letters/statements,"school administration

We participated in a drinking game that involved moving cups in the form of a swastika. The symbol was mistakenly and ignorantly formed with no racist intent. We could not be more remorseful knowing we unintentionally hurt many. Our terrible actions have devastated our community and the strong reputation of STA women has been tarnished. We are sincere in our apologies towards our fellow students, faculty and all else effected by our actions. We respect the opinions of everyone, knowing you are speaking from your heart. We acknowledge the pain our actions have caused and fully recognize the terror that is associated with the swastika symbol. To reconcile our actions we plan on doing service to those affected by the hatred this symbol stands for. The thought of anyone feeling unsafe, uncomfortable or unwelcome because of our incredibly inconsiderate actions is sickening to us. We want to remember and learn from this mistake moving forward. We hope the girls that brought this to the attention of the school community know that we respect them and harbor no ill feelings. We are asking for your forgiveness knowing it will take time to earn back your respect. It will be at the forefront of everything we do moving forward. We aim to emphasize that we had no intention of aligning our actions with bigotry. Despite our mistake, we do stand with all of you against any form of discrimination. Our hope is to move forward in unity and love""             "" The apology came late Sunday evening after classmates allegedly shouted “Nazi” and “racist” at the girls during the Teresian homecoming dance""; girls who went to Catholic school were disciplined but not expelled; school president came under severe scrutiny and eventually; see this article for more consequences: https://www.flatlandkc.org/commentary/students-staff-swastika-incident/ Since then, a lot has happened at the 600-student school, including: expressions of righteous anger from students appalled by their classmates’ vile action; work by the faculty, administration and board to manage the crisis and right the ship; apologies; forgiveness; a mandatory retreat with the class of which the offending students were a part; diversity training with an emphasis on interfaith understanding; outside speakers; outside consultants, and more.    Letter from school via Facebook: Our community was recently challenged by an event off campus, involving a group of students participating in a drinking game that included a hateful symbol. Unfortunately, as with high schools all across the country, we deal with underage drinking on a regular basis. This incident was irregular; it was something we have never faced before and it has shaken us to our core. 
Our students and alumnae have expressed great levels of concern, as they should, and we are proud of this response. Our mission is to develop strong women, and this strength is shining through.
To reiterate, we condemn discrimination of any kind. 
Many of you have questioned the consequences and called for expulsion of the students involved. While we respect your opinion, expulsion is the wrong solution in this situation. We live the mission of the Sisters of St. Joseph. Our students are taught to care for the dear neighbor, “neighbor to neighbor, without distinction.” That teaching guides us in every decision we make. 
St. Teresa’s Academy educates and empowers young women for the future. It’s more than developing the individual academically, spiritually and emotionally. It’s about becoming part of something bigger and discovering themselves along the way. It’s about rising to their individual potential and striking their path with the strength and support of their sisters, their community and their faith.
The last week has been a challenging one. Our job as educators is to use these incidents, when they occur, as opportunities to teach our young women what it means to care about their dear neighbor. We have more work to do.
In the weeks ahead, we will be announcing several new initiatives addressing issues this incident has brought to light. We promise to stay true to our mission and to keep you fully informed.
Inscribed on the cornerstone of our first campus building are the words: “With the help of God, we need not fear.” We ask for your prayers for our young women and our extended community.
Respectfully,
Nan Bone

 Principal Lauren Feltz told The Bulletin on Friday that the swastika was “immediately taken down” and a second swastika was later discovered. She said that was also “immediately removed.” According to an Oct. 6 letter from Superintendent Kevin Smith, the parent of the child who drew the swastika came forward the morning of Friday, Oct. 6. “While neither I nor any member of our administration will in any way minimize the impact of this incident,” Smith wrote, “I took some small comfort in learning that the child very clearly did not understand the full meaning of the symbol or the repercussions of drawing it.” “While no excuse can or should be made for this action, in talking with the student, it is clear that the intent in making the graffiti was not a message of hate,” she wrote.
 
 “While the child understands the historical gravity of the symbol and antiSemitism in general, the student was not personally intending to make an antisemitic statement. Of course, this in no way decreases the negative impact this has had on our school community.”","This community took it to the limit.

Moments like these also provide an opportunity for our entire community to speak with a unified voice in rejecting antiSemitism and racism, as well as to affirm those values we stand for such as Respect for Human Differences and Building and Maintaining Cooperative and Caring Relationships. I ask that you consider conversations at home that reinforce these messages. Dr. Chisum has some excellent suggestions in his letter on how to approach this topic.

 Regretfully, I am writing again to inform you of another incident of hate speech and hate-symbols that we found yesterday at HPMS. In an eighth grade boys restroom, we found a swastika on the side of a toilet paper holder. The swastika had an ethnic slur written four times on it. On the other side of the toilet paper holder, we found the words, ""Heil Hitler"" and a second swastika. After the first incident I reported to you on December 11th, we increased our monitoring, and we feel we are very close to finding and holding accountable the person who is responsible.
 
 Our eighth grade English Language Arts teachers spoke to each class after the last incident ensuring that our students understand the repercussions of this behavior. There is no excuse. Additionally, our students just completed reading, ""The Diary of Anne Frank"" and will read ""Night"" when we return from the break. I highly recommend that you read and discuss ""Night"" along with your eighth grader. I ask again for your support, especially if you are the parent of an eighth grade boy. Please discuss with your child the harm that is done to our school and our society when hate speech and hate-symbols are displayed.
 
 I commend the many eighth grade students who are appalled by these acts and continue to stand up and speak against them.
 
 Sincerely,

The Alred University college president gave the following statement Thursday: Last night while residence hall staff completed their rounds inside MacKenzie North, they quickly and dutifully reported a new etching of hateful images including a swastika and ‘KKK.’ University Police were already in the building and immediately began investigating. As a result, a NON-student visiting the campus was arrested for criminal mischief and felony aggravated harassment in the first degree.

Northern Liberties is an inclusive community nourished by the contributions of people from all backgrounds and walks of life. This act of hatred and stupidity only redoubles our commitment to remain an open neighborhood that embraces the diversity of everyone who lives, works, attends school, visits, and patronizes businesses here. Unfortunately, voices of hate in our nation have felt emboldened in the past year or so, as documented by both Philadelphia and nationwide statistics showing an increase in hate-crimes. Today’s graffiti was an act of cultural terrorism, meant to frighten us, throw us off balance, and give the false impression that these hateful views are widely held or tolerated. But we will not let the perpetrator of this act change how we live, how we treat our neighbors, and how we affirm our values in word and deed. We have been in direct contact with one of the home’s residents to offer support. We thank the City of Philadelphia for its immediate response: the CLIP service for quickly removing the graffiti, the 26th Police District and East Detectives Division for getting on the case, and the Commission on Human Relations for reaching out to offer assistance and information. We know all Philadelphians of good conscience stand with us today, and join us in our commitment to repudiate hatred and bigotry not only with our words, but also by the example of how we live and thrive together, as a community, today and far into the future.

Last week, Residential Life asked students who had not evacuated campus for information to guide the investigation into the two incidents. As of Tuesday, no disciplinary action has been taken, as administrators are still attempting to find the individuals involved, according to a Columbia College spokesperson.   statement issued by dean of undergraduate life: Dear Columbia College and Columbia Engineering Students,

I write now, to those of you who remain on campus, regarding a deeply concerning issue. On two separate occasions during the past week, I have learned that someone drew a swastika on a wall of the 16th-floor hallway in East Campus. After staff were notified, the drawings were immediately removed, and Residential Life followed up with residents on the floor to ask for information and offer support. Although these symbols are no longer physically present, the hurt and injury left behind continue to ripple across our community.

I remind you that this profoundly offensive, antisemitic symbol is in direct conflict with the University’s core value of inclusivity and has no place in our community. These acts are unacceptable, and we continue to stand strongly against antisemitism and all forms of hatred. Even amidst the chaos enveloping not only our own community but the global community, bigotry and hatred will not be overlooked or excused.

It is especially disheartening that these incidents have occurred in this moment, when we need to — now more than ever — support each other as a community. Together, you have faced many hardships over the course of the past several weeks. Many of your classmates were asked to depart campus and fulfill the requests from authorities and health experts to reduce Columbia’s population density. Those of you who remain do so because you face an individual hardship. It remains essential that you demonstrate compassion and care for one another at this time, even though the ways we are able to come together as a community have been drastically altered.

We are speaking with each of the residents of the 16th floor of East Campus, and we reach out to you now to ask that you let us know if you have any information about these incidents. You may contact me directly at cs867@columbia.edu. Given that residents are not able to sign in or host guests in our residence halls, we may now be more likely to identify who is responsible and are working with campus partners to gather and analyze all available information. Any information you have may help us in this investigation and will also be a stand against offensive acts that hurt us all.

I imagine that many of you will also receive this news with heavy hearts and a mix of other emotions. Know that we are still here to support you, even if we cannot meet in person. Columbia Health services, including Medical Services and Counseling and Psychological Services, are available via virtual delivery. I, and staff in Residential Life, also remain available to support you via phone or email. Please reach out to reslife@columbia.edu to connect.

In community,

Cristen Kromm

We do not yet know all the facts and an investigation is underway.  While it will take time before the necessary reviews have been completed, what we can say unequivocally right now is that Lesley is a community committed to diversity, inclusion, and the wellbeing of all students, faculty, staff, and guests of the university.  The use of this reprehensible symbol and this incident of vandalism violates our Community Standards and everything for which we as a university stand.  Acts of hatred, whether grounded in bigotry or ignorance, impact us all, they have no place in our community or a civil society, and we will not tolerate them. If anyone has information related to these acts of vandalism, I encourage you to contact Michele Trifiro, Director of Campus Safety and Services at 617-349-8687 or michele.trifiro@lesley.edu.

YU security currently has a full-time presence to monitor the apartment buildings on Laurel Hill Terrace, explained Apfelbaum. Despite the increase in surveillance, vandalism has persisted in the area.
 
 “The super, YU Security and YU Housing have demonstrated an inability to communicate effectively and a sense of nonchalance that I would find unsettling should there be more serious incidents,” remarked Netanel Paley, a resident of 24 Laurel Hill Terrace for the last five months.
 
 According to Paley, residents of the buildings received no information about the cameras or steps being taken to curb such incidents. Additionally, to date, YU Security has not reported the incidents to the greater student body.
 
 “One would think a university would be more concerned about the safety of its own students and alumni, especially on their own property, so this is very disappointing,” said Paley.
“Educating our children and residents on how to respond and fight hate is an important proactive measure we can take to create safe and inclusive communities,” said Evan Bernstein, Regional Director of the Anti-Defamation League in New York and New Jersey. “We have seen the response from the Washington Heights community speaking out against recent acts of bias and we stand with them and will continue working together to make every neighborhood no place for hate.” “The security of our students, faculty and community is of utmost importance to us,” said Apfelbaum. “We will continue to work closely with the Police Department and our YU security team to ensure everyone’s safety.”","apartment complex owned by Yeshiva University; article notes how in In an annual report, the Anti-Defamation League found a 57 percent increase of reported antisemitic incidents in the U.S. during 2017. other swastika incidents reported in this area as well...",school administration,other,"school administration

As you may be aware through media reports, this morning one of our students reported seeing a swastika carved into the back of a seat in one of our classrooms. As soon as University authorities were notified, USA Police reported to the scene, verified the presence of the swastika, and steps were taken to eradicate the symbol from the classroom. University Police are investigating, and I encourage anyone with information to please call 251-460-6312 or use the LiveSafe app to make a report.

This is the second occurrence this week involving a symbol of intolerance and hatred found on our campus. These symbols have no place in our community, they are in opposition to everything our University community stands for, and we are committed to taking action whenever the rules of our campus community are violated.

It's difficult and painful for all of us to witness and confront the realities of intolerance, bigotry and racism in our world. It's much more difficult and painful when those behaviors happen on our own campus. It hurts when an individual or group takes action that disturbs us, and even frightens us. But these incidents remind us that we must and will stand united, together, as a community, to support and respect one another. Our mutual respect and support for each other is the best defense against these kinds of despicable actions.

The past few days have been very difficult for our University family. When any person on our campus takes an action that makes others feel unsafe or afraid, it's confusing and hurtful to the vast majority of us, who believe in treating others with dignity and respect. The most important thing we can do in the face of these actions is to stand together, support each other, and take action in our own lives to show that we care for and respect each other.

For those of you who are having a particularly difficult time understanding or dealing with these recent events, please know that we are here to help. If you need assistance, do not hesitate to reach out to our counseling services office, the dean of students, or any member of the faculty or staff. Please also know that our commitment to your safety and security is at the forefront of all that we do to make the University of South Alabama a community that we all remain proud to be a part of.

 “There needs to be some sort of collaborative effort between the schools, the clergy and the community to inform and educate now,” she said. “I don’t think we can sweep it under the rug, which is what happened before.” Damashek said that last February her son found a swastika in a bathroom, and the school’s principal, Eileen Cambria, called it a “disturbing graffiti symbol scratched on a small section of a panel in the first-floor boys’ restroom,” in her email to parents.
 
 That vague language left some wondering what that symbol was and, Damashek said, left her feeling the full story hadn’t been told. “Appropriate consequences will be administered,” Cambria said in the email. “Take the time to talk to your child at home about this symbol-of-hate,” she said. “It is not an easy conversation, but it is a very important one.” School Board President Gretchan Ohlig condemned the student’s graffiti and promised to continue the district’s work educating students on issues of diversity. “Acts like this are unacceptable and Dr. Cambria and her staff have and continue to handle the response to this event in a way that makes that clear,” Ohlig said. “The district remains focused on educating our students on issues of diversity and inclusiveness and will continue to partner with families and our community in doing this work.” Rabbi Douglas Sagal of Temple Emanu-El said Friday that he plans to meet with school district officials to discuss ways to approach a community conversation surrounding the incident.",,school administration,suspension/denial of access to space,"school administration

 The college then had to decide whether it would make any effort to alert the student body, staff and faculty to the incident. It was not a straightforward process.

 The email that Trueblood referred to was sent last Nov. 3 amidst a series of swastikas and other hate-related incidents on campus, and contained a message to students, faculty and staff from President Brian Rosenberg.
 
 “We didn’t have a lot of clarity in trying to figure that piece out,” she continued, “but decided that something had to happen and that students did need to be notified.”
 
 In it, Rosenberg wrote that, going forward, the college would “note and document” all hate markings and include them in publicly available security alerts, but not publish notices of them in the Mac Daily.
 
 “The challenge for us now,” Rosenberg wrote, “is finding the right balance between acknowledging the occurrence of these incidents and not encouraging more of them by giving the perpetrator or perpetrators what they so clearly want: attention.”
 
 In response to that decision and the proliferation of racist speech, political science professor Althea Sircar wrote an open letter published in The Mac Weekly calling for the college to engage in a “rigorous and sustained critique of and opposition to hateful words and actions.” Within a week, it received more than 600 signatures from students, staff and faculty. The Bias Response Team is a newly-formed group to deal with incidents of hate on campus, and consists of Trueblood, Collumbien, Assistant Vice President and Dean of Students DeMethra Bradley, Title IX and Bias Harassment Coordinator Timothy Dunn and College Chaplain and Associate Dean the Rev. Kelly Stone. The group met on Wednesday to talk about its processes and communication style going forward.

“My hope is that the Bias Response Team can formulate a process and a protocol that will be responsive to incidents of bias,” Trueblood said. “We can take into consideration what the email from last year stated, but we can also take into consideration what we’re hearing from our community members and figure out how to proceed.”

Trueblood said that the team, once it figures out what its protocol around hate-incidents will be, “definitely needs” to relay it to the campus at large. “Students are asking for more transparency,” Trueblood said. “That’s something to be mindful of – and I believe that we’re not any safer when we don’t know about these situations.”

Trueblood and Associate Chaplain for Jewish Life Rabbi Emma Kippley-Ogman led Tuesday night’s gathering, which included both testimony on the significance of the swastikas to students as well as discussion of how best to activate opposition to the symbols and other hate speech in the days and weeks ahead.

The meeting drew nearly 60 students and staff members – a significantly larger number than was expected, but still just a fraction of the total population of the college.

After its conclusion, many of those present placed some 200 blue pieces of paper with the words “You Belong Here” on desks throughout the library.",,school administration,letters/statements,"school administration

Joseph M. McShane, S.J. noted that a professor reported the student’s discovery to Public Safety officers. They promptly removed the desk from the property and notified the NYPD hate-crimes Task Force of the incident.

McShane condemned the hate-symbol. “Such behavior has no place on our campus or in the heart of any Fordham woman or man,” he said. “The University will continue its efforts to ensure that the Fordham community is one in which mutual respect and our Jesuit, Catholic mission define our words and actions.”

Jewish Student Organization (JSO) president Brandon Satz-Jacobowitz expressed his disappointment in the university. “The Fordham community is supposed to be a place of diversity and respect, and for the most part it is, but sadly there are some looking to actively harm the Jewish population, students of color, and all marginalized communities at Fordham,” he said. “I’d like to extend the JSO as a safe space for all marginalized groups here and I hope we can continue the conversation about our respective identities to help make our school less painful and more inviting for everyone.”On Tuesday, Oct. 23, the Fordham Students for Sex and Gender Equity and Safety (SAGES) group, an activist group not endorsed by the university, posted on Facebook a brief recent history of hate-crimes and alt-right activities at Fordham. “We said on the post that we feared that without the Fordham community and the administration holding those that perpetuate these crimes accountable that it would continue to happen. Unfortunately, that turned out to be true,” said a Melissa Alamilla, FCLC ’17. A contributing alumnus who works closely with SAGES, Alamilla added, “ We hope that Fordham takes this opportunity to change past patterns and take this seriously. Fordham admin [sic] shows a huge double standard when they use resources to crack down on student activism towards just causes but doesn’t show the same effort towards expressions of white supremacy which is an actual threat to the safety of POC and Jewish students on these campuses.”",,school administration,letters/statements,"school administration

Heckert said in her letter last week that the graffiti was removed by building services workers and that the school is investigating. She noted that “in the eyes of the law, it can be considered a hate-crime or bias-based crime.” “This type of behavior will not be tolerated at Winston Churchill High School and those found responsible will be subject to disciplinary actions aligned with the Student Code of Conduct,” she said."," Churchill has a significant population of Jewish students and has had several antisemitic incidents in recent years, said Guila Franklin Siegel, who oversees education outreach as associate director at the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Washington.

Still, she said, “it would be wrong to assume students in middle school and high school uniformly know the history of the swastika, and why it is such a trigger, as we get farther away from the Holocaust and fewer Holocaust survivors are alive.”  
Surge of hate graffiti on bathroom walls, other areas, has Maryland county rattled

A Washington Post analysis of county school and police information showed more than three dozen bias-incidents in the 2016-2017 school year were linked to schools, mostly involving vandalism with swastikas, racial epithets or other bigoted messages.

Last school year, two swastikas were reported, Turner said. One was drawn in an elementary student’s assignment book, and another was discovered on a middle school desk.

In neighboring Washington, a swastika sticker was found on the wall in a high school bathroom Monday. Police are investigating the incident at the School Without Walls.

Also, see this article, which says in last 18 months, over 24 swastikas have shown up in town. Lot's of community response: The school department has responded by encouraging tolerance within the schools and inviting the Anti-Defamation League to help teachers create an anti-bias education program. It has also invited Holocaust survivor Dr. Anna Ornstein to speak in schools. See: The school department has responded by encouraging tolerance within the schools and inviting the Anti-Defamation League to help teachers create an anti-bias education program. It has also invited Holocaust survivor Dr. Anna Ornstein to speak in schools. From Reading Memorial High School Principal Kathleen M. Boynton: Dear RMHS Families and Staff, I am profoundly dismayed that I must report a second incident of a swastika discovered in a classroom at RMHS. [Friday] afternoon, a staff member reported to administration that a student found a swastika lightly etched on a desk in a classroom. The graffiti was difficult to see except at a certain angle and lighting. There was no threat written as part of the graffiti. Administration documented the image and the incident response protocol was initiated: The Superintendent, Reading Police and Facilities Department were all notified. The image was removed and a thorough sweep of all furniture in that classroom was conducted. No additional images were found. Facilities conducted a sweep of the building following the last incident, however, they were specifically looking for graffiti drawn in pen, pencil or marker. Following this second incident, RMHS administration will lead a systematic and thorough sweep of the entire building over the next few weeks to ensure, to the best of our ability, no additional graffiti of this nature is present at RMHS. While this is an ongoing investigation, we are uncertain when the image was created because the graffiti was difficult to see except at a certain angle and lighting conditions.  Learn More Unfortunately, we continue to have these graffiti related incidents in our schools and in our community. The swastika symbolizes hate and antiSemitism and there is no place for these types of hateful actions or behaviors in our schools or in the greater Reading community. The actions of one person cannot be allowed to overshadow the tremendous kindness, respect, empathy and acceptance our students, staff and greater RMHS community embody every day inside and outside of the classroom. Over the past few years, RMHS staff has focused our efforts on making our core values of Respect, Responsibility, Perseverance and Scholarship come to life as we continue to build a community that embraces diversity. Last year, Dr. Anna Ornstein, a holocaust survivor spoke with students at an assembly hosted by our student club A World of Difference, which is sponsored by the Anti-Defamation League. We also had students and staff trained as upstanders and RMHS hosted the Unity Project, a very powerful interactive public art project about embracing difference. This year, we began the year with Community Day, which was an entire day devoted to our core values and to building a positive RMHS community. We have further training planned this year for our A World of Difference Club along with several other student leadership organizations such as our Peer Leaders, Rocket Ambassadors and Student Council. Furthermore, just last weekend, Reading residents came together at a rally to speak out against hate and antiSemitism, which makes the discovery of the graffitti yesterday all the more troubling. In a society that has turned increasingly divisive and polarized, it is crucial that we emphasize kindness, empathy, and respect for difference and continually speak out with a unified voice against hate. We seek to find those responsible for these acts and we must continue to educate our entire community if we hope to prevent these acts from reoccurring. On Monday, we will notify students of the incident, and will ask them for any information that might guide us in a direction towards identifying the person(s) responsible for the graffiti. We will continue to use situations like these as teachable moments to help students understand the impact of these hateful acts and to reinforce our core values of respect and responsibility along with kindness, empathy and acceptance. We will continue to work closely with the Reading Police Department, the Superintendent and the Town of Reading to address this and any future issues. If you have any questions, concerns or information about this incident, please do not hesitate to contact me. Sincerely, Kathleen M.

Residents, resident assistants and resident directors were in attendance.

“We want all members of our community to feel welcome and safe, and the best ones to promote that feeling are the other students in the community,” Rod Aeschlimann, the director of Residential Life, Housing & Food Services said. “Students are asked to listen to each other and to reach out to others for support….. to be watchful and aware of friends most affected by fear and emotion, letting them know your own personal support of them and encouraging utilization of campus resources if appropriate.”

At the meeting, it was announced there was an open hate-crime investigation. Several rooms in the area of the carved swastika were interrogated by the police. In order to avoid similar situations in the future, students suggested for the installation of cameras in the hallway or to have resident assistants conduct 24-hour watch on all floors.

”We wanted to remind the community that these acts of hate and discrimination not only create an environment of hostility but are a violation of university policy.” Amanda Chavez, the resident director of Peavine and Edtivia Rutherford, the graduate resident director of Peavine said in an email to Peavine residents. “We are a welcoming community that strives to embrace diversity and inclusion. We are made up of people from different backgrounds, races and ethnicities, religions, genders, sexual orientations, and abilities. All of us deserve the right to be treated with respect and live in an environment where we are not subject to discrimination. Read the linked article for more. Also read this article for more on community response: http://nevadasagebrush.com/blog/2019/03/13/swastika-found-in-juniper-hall-student-leaders-address-antiSemitism/. It says In response to the Peavine incident, ASUN held a town hall meeting on Wednesday, Nov. 7, 2018 to address student concerns. Around 100 students, faculty and concerned individuals attended the event. Topics of discussion included discrimination, sexual assault and Tau Kappa Epsilon. Some students condemned the university for not addressing antiSemitism properly and others felt the university did not support its Jewish students. In February 2019, President Hannah Jackson announced her partnership with Sigma Alpha Epsilon Pi sorority and Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity in order to create workshops to address antiSemitism on campus. ASUN, Student Services and Hillel plan to bring the Anti-defamation League of Nevada on campus for training. The Residence Hall Association held a town hall meeting in December 2018  to address students living in the resident halls’ concerns. Some students called for more transparency between housing and students since they were unsure if any action was being done. Students suggested more surveillance in the halls of student housing, increased security, more education on diversity and culture and stricter discipline on hate-crimes. Here, Associated Students of the University of Nevada announced they were planning a diversity and inclusion event for April 2019. RHA also advocated for residence halls’ Leadership Council to think of events or activities aimed at inclusion and diversity.",,school administration,gathering/protest/vigil/demonstration,"school administration

Theyinclude a threatening note in the Lied Library that read, “Kill the Blacks,” to vandalism on university property using swastikas in the MPE Building on Yom Kippur, to most recently, a direct threat of engraving a swastika on a student’s dorm -room door.This has to stop, and everyone has to be part of the solution. This is not who we are and we allneed to communicate strongly that we will not tolerate threats of violence, nor incidents ofharassment and vandalism. If you see someone engaging in this type of behavior, we need youto call UNLV Police at (702) 895- 3668. We will act. We are acting now. When we don’t know who the perpetrators are, all we can do is assert our values and let them know in no uncertainterms that their conduct does not belong among us.Sadly, there have also been reported insults hurled at gender-diverse students, as well as African- American students. As much as we’d like to, we cannot prevent people from saying hurtful things or casting insults because of gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, race, religion, orother attributes. I know some of you have experienced such behavior based on what you havepersonally conveyed to me, and it pains me deeply.The very freedom we promote on our campus to engage in the full pursuit of knowledge, ideas,and expressions of opinions guarantees individuals the broadest possible latitude to speak,write, listen, challenge, and learn. Such debate and dialogue ultimately make us stronger, butsome will use that same freedom to say what will be offensive and marginalizing to many. Theuniversity may restrict such expression when it is determined to be a threat of physical violenceor targeted harassment, but the circumstances are indeed narrowly defined by law.I know that the vast majority of the campus adheres to our core values of inclusion. I also knowthat it only takes a few people to make us all feel distressed and unsafe. We cannot and will notlive that way. So please partner with us in keeping this campus the safe and welcoming place itshould always be – without exception.","Elizabeth and her roommate are both Jewish and they decorated their door with a small mezuzah, which is a Jewish prayer.",school administration,letters/statements,"school administration

We concluded that they were written on the posters after the end of the school day the day before because there were no eyewitnesses, nobody who noticed it.”

Freeman then put the posters in her desk and, after three weeks with no further signs of disturbance surrounding the issue, eventually recycled them. Members of the JSU and the Cleveland Alliance for Racial Equity (CARE) were invited to speak on a panel at the December staff meeting about the posters and how to address antiSemitism in classrooms. JSU leaders also visited history classrooms delivering presentations about the situation, antiSemitism, and steps the students could take to prevent hate speech.  There are currently events and ideas in the works about combating hate speech and creating a safe and communicative environment at Cleveland. Vice Principal Kristy Mize hopes to plan an event including all racial affinity and sexual orientation clubs, to broadcast their voice and work collaboratively to combat hate speech heard in the hallways.

Beginning in January, Principal Freeman will be holding parent listening sessions once a month for parents and guardians to attend. Additionally, the ninth grade academy Wy’East will be taking a field trip to the Portland Art Museum exhibit of Holocaust photographs, “Memory Unearthed.” “It’s part of the work that we do as school administrators,” said Freeman. “A big part of our job is of course to teach young people how to communicate with kindness and compassion.”

Members of the JSU highlight the importance of continued involvement. “This isn’t the end of our efforts with administration and making change. We’re still going to keep working on this continuously, and if people want to get involved, then come to JSU and talk to us,” said Birk-Stachon.

Clifton Ave., and that they had contacted the Anti-Defamation League to help address the problem. Many of the parents questioned why they were not immediately contacted following the swastika incident, which happened Monday. Some of them learned about the incident through media reports, which they said was unacceptable.

But school administrators said they were in a difficult position. They wanted to first make sure the incident was isolated and had not happened on other students’ lockers. They stressed it was important to be decisive and intentional. “We will be working with [Mayer] to try to establish some sort of comprehensive plan or training for education,” Trubowitz said. “They’re really thinking about using this as an opportunity to not only instruct the student but the family members, administrators about the importance of addressing hate rhetoric, hate speech.”","one person recommended that day next week, all the students and staff wear the Star of David armbands like they did in Pittsburgh; not sure what happened; see note to pareents linked to in article",school administration,letters/statements,"school administration

Haines called the graffiti a case of criminal mischief but said it's not technically a hate-crime because there was no force, no direct threat and it was on public property.

Rabbi Herb suggested the distinction is cold comfort.

""I don’t want to second-guess the police’s judgment there because I don’t know the ins and outs of what officially makes a hate-crime,"" he said. ""But again I can say that the Jewish community experiences it as a hate-crime very deliberately targeting us."" Lt. Haines called the graffiti a case of criminal mischief but said it's not technically a hate-crime because there was no force, no direct threat and it was on public property.

Proud Boys deny being involved and issued a statement: Jason L. Van Dyke, a lawyer for the Proud Boys,  The following is the entire statement Van Dyke sent to KATU:

""A swastika is absolutely a symbol-of-hate and the spraying of graffiti is a criminal act. The Proud Boys have always condemned, and continue to condemn, the genocidal policies of Nazi Germany. The Proud Boys believe in racial equality and in the rule of law. We call upon the authorities in Monmouth to conduct a full investigation and bring swift justice to those responsible. Proud Boys did not commit these acts, we do not know who did, and we condemn them in the strongest possible terms.

The Proud Boys is a multi-racial fraternity that welcomes both straight and gay men as members. There has never been anything racist about the Proud Boys and there was a time in this country when comedians like David Chappelle ridiculed the notion of a “black white supremacist” while the rest of the nation laughed with him. Jokes like that can no longer be made in 2018 because organizations like the Southern Poverty Law Center actually believe in things that, less than twenty years ago, were dismissed as satirical humor. We have groups like the SPLC to thank for the fact that stories and headlines previously reserved for The Onion are now common in publications like The Huffington Post and The Daily Beast.

Similarly, the term 'fascist' suggests an organization that believes in absolute power for the state. If the Proud Boys stands for anything, it stands for limited government, love of country, freedom, and fun. None of those things are consistent with a fascist organization, and to say otherwise is patently absurd.""

University eventually made a statement; see above. While members of Dickson Hall said that their R.A.s have called or will soon call floor meetings in response to the incidents, none of the several CKB residents interviewed by The Sun were aware that someone drew a swastika in their living space. Deepak Ilango ’22, a resident of the fifth floor of Dickson Hall, confirmed to The Sun that the R.A. sent out an email about the incident and called a floor meeting to address the issue on Thursday. Zain Mehdi’20, one of the residential advisors in Dickson Hall, also said that he hopes to call a mandatory floor meeting soon to broach the subject to his residents “face-to-face.” The “support gathering” held on Thursday was attended by 13 individuals, roughly half of whom were administrators rather than students. One student participant told The Sun she was not aware of the incidents nor the support meeting until she accidentally walked into the Robert Purcell Community Center auditorium.

Rabbi Ari. D. Weiss, executive director of Cornell Hillel, said that the University considers the safety of Jewish students “very seriously,” adding that CUPD now has an increased presence in “recognizably Jewish events” such as services and Friday dinner at 104 West —  a Kosher dining hall. Furthermore, the campus police are training student leaders and Hillel staff on “emergency procedures,” and creating a “site-specific plan” for the Hillel office.

In addition to strengthening security, the Hillel director is also planning a series of campus outreach efforts, such as a “robust programmatic response” starting next semester to improve awareness about Jewish culture and the swastika signs.

“We believe that Hillel has a role in educating the campus community about the history of antiSemitism and how antisemitism manifests today in 21st-century America,” Weiss said, elaborating on the topics Hillel expects to cover in its planned programming.",,school administration,letters/statements,"school administration

He added that “we are here to help foster a welcoming campus community, and we always encourage anyone who feels unsafe to let us know so we can address their concerns.”“We need to be vigilant because our campuses are under increasing antisemitic attack from white-supremacist and neo-Nazi groups,” said Elan Karoll, a senior and executive board member of Illini Public Affairs Committee. “Pro-Israel and Jewish campus leaders need to create strategies to combat these hate groups. Our agenda cannot be exclusively focused on SJP and the far-left Israel-haters anymore.” University of Illinois Hillel executive director Erez Cohen told JNS about the support the Jewish community on campus has received since not just the discovery of the swastika, but also in the aftermath of the deadliest attack in American Jewish history.

“Our staff and students are empowered and strengthened by the support we have received from the greater community since the Pittsburgh shooting and through the discovery of Swastikas last week,” he said. “We received an out-pour of calls, emails and letters of support of the Jewish community in Champaign-Urbana.”

“This signals to us that malicious acts of individuals do not represent the true nature of the University of Illinois community,” added Cohen. “Hillel is working with the authorities and the University of Illinois to ensure that our students are always safe and proud. We will continue to grow our vibrant Jewish community on campus.”

University of Illinois Chabad Rabbi Dovid Tiechtel reacted to this incident occurring just before the Festival of Lights.

“The antisemitic vandalism is both shocking and disgusting,” he told JNS. “This incident has shaken all of us. It is particularly concerning that on a campus as wonderful as ours, this can be happening.”

“As Chanukah approaches this Sunday, we must stand as a light against the darkness of ignorance, hatred and discrimination, and we will not be cowed. Chabad’s menorah-lighting ceremony on Sunday at 5 p.m. on the Main Quad will be bigger and prouder than ever,” he continued. “We invite all of the administration, faculty, students and the entire community to join the ceremony and stand with us in support of the Jewish community, against antiSemitism and hatred.”","According to investigators, it is unknown if the incident is connected to white nationalist organization Identity Evropa, which canvassed on campus around then.

Identity Evropa denied involvement. “Our activity is strictly limited to the Identity Evropa stickers and posters on this campus,” spokesperson Sam Harrington told JNS. “We are committed to peaceful displays of defiance against globalism, and the advocacy of violence or supremacy is not permitted in our organization.”",school administration,letters/statements,"school administration

The swastika has historically been – and continues to be – used as a symbol of intolerance, terror and repression against vulnerable communities.”

Lombardi said the affected dorms have had floor meetings with their resident advisers and that residence hall directors have sent building-wide support messages and lists of resources to help students deal with the incidents.

I firmly believe that this incident does not define us as a community; we are compassionate and respectful. We support one another and we must continue to stand up against hatred and bigotry wherever we see it.”  Since the symbols were discovered at the middle school and the public was subsequently informed by the Summit School District, the Hilltop City community has reacted with shock, sadness and resolve, handing out flyers at the middle school denouncing hate of any kind -- 'No Room For Hate' -- and taping the flyers on school lockers. Yard signs have also begun to spring up around neighborhoods with a similar message.

Summit parent Lisa Stein started both an online signup to let parents know that flyers would be distributed this morning at LCJSMS, and the Facebook group “No Room for Hate,” which is modeled after the Hate Has No Home Here organization. Yesterday, in response to the LCJSMS incident, Rabbi Avi Friedman made a public statement on the Summit Jewish Community page.  

He wrote, “Swastikas? Again?  When I see a red octagon, I stop.  The meaning of that symbol has been ingrained in me for as long as I can remember.  It does not have to have the word “stop” written on it. The symbol is enough to elicit a response.  It is one of many symbols that have that kind of power over me.

Another symbol which immediately elicits a response in me is the swastika – the emblem of Nazi Germany. Without saying a word, the presence of a swastika tells me that I am “other,” that I am hated and that I am in danger. It is not something I read in a book or saw in a movie that causes this response. It is the real-life experiences of family members. Like most other Jews my age, I grew up with relatives who had numbers tattooed on their arms. From an early age, I knew the stories of who got out of Europe when and who didn’t get out.  It was just a part of Jewish life.

So, when I heard – over a week after the fact – that swastikas had been graffitied on the wall of a bathroom in our local middle school, I had a visceral reaction that was out of my control. Now, to be clear, I don’t believe that there are Nazis here in Summit, New Jersey. Further, I don’t believe that our school district in any way condones the use of that symbol. That being said, I was underwhelmed by the response of our educational leaders.

Adolescents are supposed to test the boundaries of what is acceptable behavior and what is not.  That’s their job. The teen or teens who put those swastikas on the wall were experimenting. They wanted to see what kind of response that symbol would elicit. It’s the job of adults to make sure that those adolescents know when they’ve crossed a line.

Having an assembly with 12 components and making the response to the swastikas item #11 on the list is not exactly sending the message that this behavior is unacceptable in our community. And yet, that was the response of our school district. Further, parents were not notified about the assembly."" Grimaldi's message, in full, reads:

""Dear SHS Parents/Guardians, 

Please find the announcement I made this afternoon to all students regarding swastikas found at SHS. Please speak to your student about this issue, and let me know if you have any questions. 

Thank you, 
Stacy Grimaldi 
Principal 

This afternoon I was informed about the presence of several swastikas that were carved into two of the boys' bathroom stalls in the building. We have contacted the Summit Police Department and are working with them to find the perpetrator of these symbols of hatred. These acts of hatred and bigotry will not be tolerated at Summit High School. It is a priority of our school and district to create a safe and accepting learning environment for all students. Any act that violates this commitment will be swiftly and firmly addressed. 
If you know who did this or have any information about the source of this hatred, please see me as soon as possible. In addition, please report any acts of hatred to an administrator or teacher immediately. There is no room for hatred at Summit High School or in the Summit community.

Summit High School

Stacy Grimaldi""

Moments ago, an e-mail from Superintendent of Schools June Chang was sent out to District parents. It reads:

""Dear Parents/Guardians,

It saddens me to have to reach back out to you regarding another act of hatred. This afternoon we were notified of swastikas found in two of the boy’s bathrooms at the Summit High School. The discovery of these drawings came following conversations with students about ensuring our schools are safe places where everyone is welcome and valued. As a result of the conversations, a student reported the finding whereupon additional swastikas in the second bathroom were discovered. As we raise awareness about the power of these symbols and the impact of their meaning, we empower our students to come forward about such incidents and the harm they can inflict.

We feel it imperative that you remain aware of incidents like this as we continue to combat acts of hatred.

As stated in my November 29th letter to parents and guardians, “Acts of hate of any kind in the Summit Public Schools will not be tolerated. We take pride in our continual efforts to make the Summit Public Schools a safe and welcoming place for all of our students and staff. We value our diversity, and are serious about promoting kindness, acceptance, and understanding within our community.”

As was done at the middle school, all students at the high school were addressed, and were informed that hatred will not be tolerated or accepted. The Summit Police were contacted, and have been informed about these additional incidents. The police and school-wide investigation continues. Disciplinary action will be taken against any individual(s) involved in the incident.

I reiterate the importance of addressing this or any act of hatred ‘head-on’. Each of our schools continue to engage in conversations underscoring the importance of confronting hateful incidents, in addition to promoting appropriate behavior and actions that protect and support all of our students. Again, we encourage all Summit Schools families to engage with their children and neighbors in conversations about ending hatred and bigotry and promoting kindness and compassion.

I am pleased to report that excellent conversations about these incidents, and the need to combat hate, occurred today as part of the advisory program at the middle school. Hundreds of signs were hung on the walls and lockers at LCJSMS today stating simply that hate has no place in Summit. I am impressed by the sense of unity and the positive response of the LCJSMS staff and students. I am confident that the students and staff at Summit High School will also unite to stand against this type of behavior.

We continue to work with the Summit Police Department, our guidance counselors, and staff to create an environment that is accepting of ALL students, and will continue to enhance our role in delivering those positive messages to the students and staff of the Summit Public Schools.

Thank you.

Sincerely,

June Chang Superintendent of Schools""",,school administration,letters/statements,"school administration

Last Thursday, about 200 University of Massachusetts students, faculty and staff marched through campus demanding the university do more to address the increasing racism and white supremacy on campus.

Demands included that the UMass Amherst Police Department ""abolish the 'Anonymous Tip Line' that targets people of color.""

The student responsible has been found and will be held responsible by the school’s discipline policy, but will not face any charges because it’s not considered a crime. School officials say they are working with the student to make this a learning opportunity, but are also asking all parents to talk to their kids about the impact words and actions have. Letter from superintendent:HCPSS Board Chair and Superintendent Respond to Hateful Incident Dear HCPSS Community, We want to address an incident that occurred at Howard High School on Monday. A swastika and male genitalia were created in the snow on the field hockey field. This field is visible to cars driving by on Route 108, and was seen by students and staff arriving to school Tuesday morning. We commend Principal Nick Novak and his team on acting quickly to remove the offensive symbols and working with the Howard County Police Department (HCPD) to identify the student involved. While this may not officially be considered a crime, we strongly condemn this act-of-hate and will hold the responsible person accountable to the extent permitted by our discipline policy. The actions of a single student unfairly distracts from the work we are doing in our schools and offices to establish inclusive learning environments and build a restorative culture. While we will continue to work with the student who committed these acts in a restorative approach and leverage their actions to become learning opportunities, we cannot stress enough the importance of families talking to their children about the impact-of-hate-symbols and speech. We ask all Howard County families to engage your children in conversations about acceptance of all people and the impact their words and actions can have. Just like we do in our schools, please engage our young people about the importance of practicing civility and being mindful of the impact their actions have on others. An act like the one at Howard was easily erased by sweeping the snow. However, the impact it had on others cannot be so easily swept away. We are seeing a disturbing trend in Howard County, and across the country, of messages and actions being instigated on various groups of people for no other reason than hate or ignorance of the impact it may have. These acts are not a “prank” or “joke” and HCPSS will continue to work closely with HCPD to hold those who commit these acts responsible to the full extent permitted by law and system policy. Thank you for your continued partnership in making our schools and community a place where everyone feels safe, welcome and included. Sincerely, Mavis Ellis, Chair, Board of Education Michael J.

At Centennial High School, our focus is to provide your child with a quality education in a safe and orderly environment. I am sending this letter to share information about some offensive graffiti that was found on several areas of our school building and campus. I am especially disgusted that this perpetrator or group of perpetrators painted a swastika, a historic and extreme emblem of hatred, on our school.

Once the graffiti was discovered, we immediately contacted the Fulton County Schools Police Department and they are in contact with the Roswell Police Department. Our custodians are in the process of removing the graffiti and restoring our building.

Let me be extremely clear, graffiti and school vandalism will not be tolerated and our community rejects the hatred these symbols represent. Be assured that as Centennial Knights, we find these actions offensive and completely against our beliefs as an open and accepting school community. This morning, I was in touch with several Rabbi’s in the community and met on a unified response to this event. I hope you will take time to talk with your student about the consequences for this kind of behavior as outlined in our Student Code of Conduct handbook. If you or your student has any information that will assist our security team in identifying the perpetrators, please contact me directly via the information below.

The MIT Police determined the incident “does not meet the criteria for a hate-crime” and is still investigating the act, according to a statement emailed to The Tech. The BSU is planning to file a crime report, Green said.

“Consistent with the cyclical nature of racial and racist progress, it came only 23 hours later: not in the form of an assassination or a riot — that is, not in the form of physical violence — but in the form of hate expressed through six lines [of the swastika] that represent global systemic violence, racism, and antiSemitism,” Green and Mimi Wahid ’21, attorney general of the BSU, wrote in an opinion article for The Tech.

“Though this act of hatred disturbs us, it neither destroys us nor diminishes our power. We remain grounded in the strength of our community,” the article continued.

The following day, Vice President and Dean for Student Life Suzy Nelson and Interim Institute Community and Equity Officer Alyce Johnson sent a letter to the MIT community detailing the incident.

“While the symbol has positive origins in the Buddhist, Hindu, and Jain faith traditions, in a modern Western context, other versions of this symbol have been used to convey a message of hate, racism, and antiSemitism,” they wrote.

They continued, “But the fact that it was drawn on a Black History Month display designed to encourage community discussion about issues affecting the black community and celebrate black student activism at MIT makes it that much worse.”

They encouraged the MIT community to “passionately reaffirm the core values our community stands for: empathy, compassion, inclusiveness, and respect for all.” Violence Prevention and Response and the Bias Response Team were alerted of the incident. The BSU is planning to file a crime report, Green said.","This is weird incident. Swastika also accompanied by “Still, once the Buddhists saw it was being used for hate, they stopped using it.

Further, one of the cuts made was in the shape of a swastika. The canopy was removed immediately by our maintenance crews, and the police were notified simultaneously. Next week, we are putting external cameras on the MDES school building so we can monitor the school site remotely. “We are fairly certain children on the playground were unaware of the symbol because it was among a series of slashes in the canopy. “This symbol-of-hate is unacceptable in our community and this incident does not reflect the values of our families or the Falls Church City Public Schools.

“This is a matter we take very seriously and are handling it that way,” she said.

Kinley said the letter was sent so that parents and students knew the full story.

“I’m very glad that we are all making a statement that the vast majority of us believe that this is disgusting,” senior Sam Quattrociocchi said during lunch. “Some people at the party thought they were making an edgy joke, and they were completely wrong.”     Newport Harbor Principal Sean Boulton said in a statement that Monday’s community meeting at the school was to include him, Costa Mesa High Principal Jacob Haley, Estancia High Principal Michael Halt and Rabbi Reuven Mintz of the Chabad Center for Jewish Life.

“The goal of the event is to start a significant conversation to take us to a place where this sort of behavior never happens again in our community,” Boulton said. “Over the past few years, all Newport-Mesa schools have worked tirelessly to eliminate prejudice, hate and bullying and continually work toward true tolerance and equality. We are obviously not there yet, but the journey continues.

The university sent out an email on Tuesday, March 12, signed by Director of Residential Life Jerome Maese, Executive Director of Residential Life, Housing and Food Services Rod Aeschlimann, Associate Vice President of Student Life and Services Jerry Marczynski and Vice President of Student Services Shannon Ellis to inform undergraduate students about the swastika in Juniper Hall. University Police Services were contacted and Juniper held a community meeting to discuss this event, according to the email. The email said Housing Facilities fixed the area of concern and the incident is under investigation by Equal Opportunity and Title IX.

“This symbol and the threatening remarks that accompanied it are unacceptable and wrong,” said the email. “We strongly condemn any symbols and actions that represent hate, intimidation or terror. We stand with members of our Jewish community and all people who find such hateful symbols and abhorrent threats to be offensive, and we will work with a number of groups to ensure that our campus remains safe and welcoming.”Dean of Students Kimberly Thomas said the incident is being investigated by the university and encourages students to go to support services if they need it.  “antiSemitism is never acceptable,” Dean of Students Kimberly Thomas and Maese said in an email to the Nevada Sagebrush. “The university has policies that address behaviors that discriminate against or threaten others as a result of race or ethnicity. After the residence hall was vandalized with a swastika and a threatening statement, both were seen and reported. The residence hall staff notified the University Police and filed a report with the expectation that the police would investigate the complaint. Both departments followed through with separate investigations into the incident. Also, Residence Life staff held a community meeting that same evening to make members of that community aware and ask for their assistance in identifying anyone who may have perpetrated the act. The police and the residence hall staff will continue to investigate discriminatory and threatening acts when discovered or reported to the fullest extent possible to include seeking criminal charges or processing the report through the Office of Student Conduct on campus. We encourage students to remain alert and aware of who visits the residence halls. The awareness of students who reside in the residence halls is important especially in the event that investigations are necessary. We need to know names, descriptions, times, and associates, if identifiable, in order to conduct a thorough investigation that can withstand a criminal or conduct process. We want to believe that students will be more comfortable in their private spaces like residence halls if they believe that our responses will be swift, sensitive, and thorough.”  Also, read about this report that cites this incident: https://stopuniversitysupportforterrorists.org/news/jew-hatred-university-nevada-reno",,school administration,letters/statements,"school administration

Parvey was heavily criticized for her statement at the time only saying she was “disappointed”; Starvaggi was similarly criticized for a statement that expressed doubt on whether a Swastika is hate speech.
“If this is truly a hate message, we want to address that very directly and take it very seriously,” he said. “If this is a matter of a teenager putting something up there not realizing the depth of it, then we need to do a lot more education throughout the building,” said Starvaggi.
New Rochelle Mayor Noam Bramson, whose family were Holocaust survivors, was unequivocal, describing the swastika “a symbol of hatred and genocide” whose appearance “in the heart of our community is deeply upsetting, especially in the context of increasingly prevalent incidents of antiSemitism nation-wide,” he said.

The Albert Leonard Middle School incident was reported to police on Thursday morning. The matter is currently under police investigation.

But Supervisor Travis says the paint thinner took off some important information from the signs. So, on April 8th through 10th, the county Road Commission replaced the two signs with swastikas. Travis posted remarks on social media about his “disgust” for the “haters” who post such graffiti. And he tells FOX 17 he has a message for the public, in general:

Yesterday, I was saddened to learn that a swastika had been found on the facade of a building on the Arts Quad. Apparently, it had been there for quite some time. This symbol of hatred, intolerance and antiSemitism has no place at Cornell. While this cowardly act, which is being investigated by the Cornell University Police Department, defaced the physical campus, it will not deter us from our ongoing efforts to build an inclusive, empathetic and loving campus community.

The Free Expression Tunnel is a place on our campus where we allow for such expression, even if we are not in support of it. However, these specific acts take on additional weight because they occurred on the heels of several other acts of hatred and violence against the Jewish community, such as the murders at Tree of Life Synagogue and the Chabad of Poway Synagogue. We are proud to say that, as of Monday afternoon, NC State students proactively painted over these images, demonstrating the power of our community voice.

An employee found the antisemitic symbol on the front door of the community center between Greene and Gates avenues at 7 a.m. and investigators have notified the Police Department’s hate-crime bureau, a spokesman told this paper.
 
Staff and parents were in shock when they discovered the hateful symbol outside the building, which functions as a child care center, preschool, after school, and summer camp facility, according to a statement by the organization which runs the premises.

“On Wednesday morning, at JCC Brooklyn at Clinton Hill, our preschool teachers and parents were shocked to discover a swastika outside their school,” The Kings Bay Y said in an emailed statement.

This was the first time the organization was the target of a hate attack, but it is part of an uptick in bigoted speech and actions against Jews and other communities, the statement continued.

“Kings Bay Y/JCC Brooklyn was the target today for the first time that anyone can remember,” the statement read. “In some respects, this may be considered an isolated incident, but it is part of a pattern of malicious speech and actions elsewhere in our community and across our country. We will continue to be vigilant about and mindful of any acts of ignorance or hatred.”

“The swastika is a symbol of hatred, violence and antiSemitism, and SF State strongly condemns this abhorrent act, which runs counter to University values,” SFSU President Leslie Wong said in a statement. “At SF State, we continuously strive to foster a welcoming environment and we encourage students, faculty and staff and the community to report any form of hatred or violence on campus.”

Anti-Defamation League Central Pacific Regional Director Seth Brysk told the Journal in an email that the graffiti “is antiSemitism seeking to cloak itself as political discourse.  Accordingly, we worked with our partners at Hillel and Jewish Studies to alert campus administration and law enforcement for their immediate action and investigation. We are pleased they are responding to this profoundly offensive and antisemitic act and expect they will take a series of steps to reassure students.”

Brysk continued, “Sadly, expressions of antiSemitism are not new to SFSU, particularly those which conflate and confuse with legitimate criticism of Israel. Here we have an example of an apparent hate-crime using a swastika; a symbol of the attempted genocide of the Jewish people. At this time of year, Jewish students most significant challenge ought to be studying for final exams rather than confronting a vandal’s offensive message of hate, intimidation and marginalization.”

Associate Dean and Director of Global Social Action Agenda at the Simon Wiesenthal Center Rabbi Abraham Cooper said in a statement to the Journal, “No surprise about the swastika with Star of David embedded in it at SFSU. It is the same university where Jewish students had to file a lawsuit to force the administration to provide Jewish with basic protection. It is the same San Francisco State University that just a few days ago ‘gifted’ UCLA with their Professor Rabab Abdulhadi Arab and Muslim Ethnicities, who called Zionists white supremacists. So the only puzzle is why was the antisemitic slander drawn in a bathroom — could have posted it openly on the campus?”

StandWithUs CEO and co-founder Roz Rothstein, the daughter of Holocaust survivors, similarly said in a statement to the Journal, “This grotesquely offensive imagery illustrates the increasing blurred lines between anti-Israel rhetoric and outright antisemitism. We stand with Jewish students at SFSU and call on the university to use this hateful incident as a teachable moment for the entire campus community.”

American Jewish Committee Northern California director Rabbi Serena Eisenberg said in a statement to the Journal that the graffiti was “deplorable” and that the university needs to “make a serious effort to educate the campus about political expressions that cross the line into hate speech and antiSemitism.”",,school administration,letters/statements,"school administration

“IT’S SOMETHING WE HAVE TO GET IN FRONT OF BECAUSE IF THIS GETS NORMALIZED WITH STUDENTS, IMAGINE WHAT KIND OF IMPACT IT’S GOING TO HAVE ON SOCIETY AT LARGE.” — EVAN BERNSTEIN

In a June 5 statement, Glen Rock Mayor Bruce Packer and the Glen Rock City Council said, “Hate speech and hate in any form is not welcome in Glen Rock. While the Superintendent and BOE (Board of Education) are the appropriate lead on the response in the schools to this incident, we have offered our help and support in any way that they deem necessary. In the wake of this incident, we urge our community to come together; for us all to speak with our children and our neighbors; to discuss the impact of our words and actions on others, whether or not the intent is malicious.”

Anti-Defamation League (ADL) Regional Director for New York and New Jersey Evan Bernstein told the Journal the swastikas were “a continuation of a very disturbing trend that’s happening in K-12 schools in northern and central New Jersey.” He added the ADL’s 2018 Audit of antisemitic Incidents found an uptick in antisemitic instances in New Jersey schools.

“It’s something we have to get in front of,” Bernstein said, “because if this gets normalized with students, imagine what kind of impact it’s going to have on society at large.”

The ADL will be working with the Jewish Federation of Northern New Jersey to help implement its anti-bias training program called No Place for Hate in schools to prevent such antisemitic incidents, Bernstein said.",,school administration,letters/statements,"school administration

As we transition into summer, I know that many of you are looking forward to the end of our school year. There are many reasons to celebrate, as the completion of one grade marks the beginning of the next. I want to thank everyone in the community who has helped to create a strong school environment for our children.

At the same time, our school continues to work with students, in these final weeks, on respectful conduct and behavior. Recently, two (approximately) 3”x 3” swastikas were drawn in ballpoint pen in one of the boys’ bathrooms. Although we continue to investigate, any help from the community of known leads would be appreciated. Additionally, our administration has been faced with cases where students are being insensitive to issues related to race and antisemitic actions. Namely, these actions are in the form of unacceptable comments that are claimed by students to be “jokes.” Although we understand where middle school students are in their adolescent development, we also know that values and actions are formed throughout a child’s life, and as adults, we need to react to harmful behaviors when they happen. Comments are made by both students outside and within their own culture. Simply stated, there is no place for these behaviors in our school.

We are working with our community partners in making sure that coordinated, appropriate consequences and learning happens, and that the behavior stops. It is in the school environment where we hope to cultivate empathic and sensitive human beings who will live within our diverse world. When left unchecked, it is these behaviors that erode the values of our school and make our community feel less safe to all those here.

As the leader of this school, I need to express how we do not condone these actions, and how we will respond to any act that goes against our values of a “caring and cooperative community” and a “respect for human differences.” Our administration works hard to ensure that students learn through appropriate responses to these behaviors. Earlier today, I messaged my thoughts to our students, in support of our values. Our goal is to ensure that students learn to show a respect for diversity in our school. We hope as parents and guardians that you will take the time to speak to your children about these values, and how they play out in the daily actions they exhibit. I am deeply saddened that these acts have happened in our school community, and I vow to stop them. Respectfully, Mark Ito Principal, Wellesley Middle School

Superintendent Lussier’s words on the matter:
Dear Members of the WPS Community,

Earlier today, WMS Principal Mark Ito shared the attached message with the Middle School Community. Due to its content, I think this is an important message to share with our entire district. The fact that swastikas were found drawn in a school bathroom on Friday is troubling on its own.  This is even more concerning as it comes amid growing concern of reported antisemitic student behaviors at WMS. Let me be very clear that language and actions grounded in hate are unacceptable and will not be tolerated in the Wellesley Public Schools

As has been evidenced on other fronts this year, we have work to do as a district and community to ensure a safe and inclusive environment for all of our students and staff.  Thank you for your help in reinforcing these important messages with our students.",,school administration,letters/statements,"school administration

Iwanski said officers told him they have a good idea of who the man is, but since his store was targeted twice in one week and had protesters at its Drag Queen Story Hour on Saturday, the notion doesn’t make him feel much better.

“These people are feeling empowered to do this because that’s the mindset in the country right now,” Iwanski said. “That’s the leadership in the country right now.”

He told the Tulsa World last week that “we have a lot of left-leaning material. Basically it’s anti-white supremacist, pro-socialism; we also offer LGBTQ+ materials. I’m gay, and one of the other owners is trans, so we kind of hit every demographic that this group doesn’t like.”

He said Monday that the store’s supporters far outweigh its public detractors. Three random people who heard via Facebook about the vandalism showed up ready to work Monday afternoon, donning safety vests and scrubbing the sidewalk just feet from fast-moving traffic.

Tulsa City Councilor Kara Joy McKee stopped by on her way to a news conference to offer her support to the store’s owners, as well. She said she learned of the vandalism when constituents tagged her in the store’s post on Facebook.

He noted that bills have been introduced in the state Legislature in the past banning the symbol. However, he said First Amendment issues have been raised regarding free speech.

“The First Amendment is designed to protect language we all like and language we all hate,” Goodell said.

He continued, “What’s disappointing is that the swastika represents a horrific period in our world history marked by the murder of millions of people. … When someone puts a swastika sign up, it’s an affront not just to all the Jewish residents who were mass murdered, but an affront to all the veterans in the United States that fought in World War II.”


Goodell said the swastika left overnight could have been “a prank by young kids.” However, he said it’s clear those who did it “have likely forgotten that their grandfathers served in the war fighting that very symbol.”

State Sen. Todd Kaminsky, D-Long Island, introduced legislation this month requiring private and public schools to teach students in sixth- through 12th-grade the meaning of the swastika as an emblem of Nazi Germany and the noose as a symbol of racism.

The bill (S6648), which seeks to amend education law, is in the Senate Rules Committee and could be taken up when the Legislature is back in session in January.

“Bigotry and hatred have no place in our diverse community and individuals who commit such shameful acts must be brought to justice swiftly,” Kaminsky told the New York Post on Aug. 12. “Swastikas are symbols of intolerance and have no place in our society. It’s unconscionable that individuals are allowed to display swastikas, and I will continue to lead the fight to end this spate of intimidation and bigotry.”

In May 2016, Kaminsky introduced legislation that would have outlawed the public display of swastikas and charge those who display bigoted symbols with a felony hate-crime.",,representative/senator,letters/statements,"representative/senator

“It’s clear to me that it was a hate-crime and it was biased-based symbols and words trying to prompt a community reaction, in which it has,” Johnson said.

One of the businesses tagged was a daycare center.

“Having to go into somewhere where they are supposed to feel safe and seeing this the first thing in the morning, it’s so sad,” said one woman, who asked to remain unnamed. “It’s nothing we’ve seen before. It’s truly the most upsetting thing we’ve seen in a long, long time. I don’t remember anything being so hurtful and so disgusting.”

Tiffany Jackson was cleaning out her car at one of the businesses hit when she saw the graffiti.

“Oh my god. I feel disrespected. I feel very disrespected,” she said. “Heartbroken. That’s crazy.”

The Arlington police chief believes the same person, or persons, is responsible for all of the graffiti and says detectives are canvassing the area searching for surveillance video and possible witnesses.

City workers spent the day removing the hateful words and symbols from public view.

Mayor Jeff Williams says more than 100 countries are represented by residents living in Arlington and is confident investigators will make an arrest.

“It’s like the United Nations if you go to the grocery store here in Arlington,” the mayor said. “We’ve become an international city, and we want unity in our community. And we want to respect each and every one of our citizens.”

Students at Sam Houston High School, about a block away, saw pictures of the hate speech circulating on social media before seeing it in person.

“I think it’s kind of racist, but it’s kind of childish too,” said student Kevin Vallejo.

“It’s disturbing and outrageous that there are those in our society that feel they have a right to deface property either public or private,‘ Mayor Carla Filkins said in an emailed statement to the Cadillac News. “Hateful acts don’t just damage the victim: they can damage our entire community, along with our reputation. This act is not at all representative of who we are here in Cadillac.‘

Marcus Peccia, the city’s manager, called the incident “pathetic.‘

“The defacement of property, public or private, is pathetic,‘ Peccia said. It’s even more pathetic to deface public property using hate speech, he said.

Police agreed.

“The swastikas were spray-painted by an ignorant individual and the act of tagging the swastika is abhorrent and illegal,‘ city police said, in a statement released by Director Adam Ottjepka,

“The use of a hate-symbol is most egregious,‘ Peccia said in a phone interview. “And those that did it will hopefully be found and face the proper repercussions through our justice system.‘      City leaders became aware of the swastikas Monday morning. By early afternoon, Department of Public Works employees were scrubbing the paint away.

Swastikas are associated with Nazi Germany and continue to represent racism and white supremacist ideology.

Enyeart said he’d never noticed any signs of racial tension in the neighborhood.

Other people who lived nearby or who use the trail told the Cadillac News they thought it was most likely “kids‘ who had spray-painted the swastikas — people who thought they were being funny.

For police, it’s not a laughing matter.

“The Cadillac Police Department will actively investigate when these types of incidents occur,‘ Ottjepka’s news release stated. “We are taking proactive steps to lessen the chances of these occurrences and develop a suspect.‘

SPEAK UP

City leaders urged residents to speak up.

If you see that city property is damaged, not functioning or “not quite straight,‘ you can call the city at (231) 775-0181 or report online through the “report a concern‘ button at the bottom of the city’s website (or this direct link: http://www.cadillac-mi.net/forms.aspx?fid=42), Peccia said.

The investigation into the incident is ongoing. Anyone with information has been asked to contact Bonamo directly at the high school.

“If even one member of our community feels unwelcome or distressed by this incident, that is one person too many,” he added. “All students, families, and staff members must feel equally included and respected by each of us.

I am writing to inform you of a recent event that warrants our attention as a community.

This afternoon, graffiti was discovered in a bathroom stall consisting of a swastika that had been etched into a toilet-paper dispenser. This symbol has significant historical and political significance as one of anti-Semitism, hatred, and intolerance. It is often used to express opposition to efforts to build an inclusive, tolerant, and safe society.

Because of the private location of where this was found, it will be nearly impossible to identify the individual(s) responsible for this action; it would be unfair to cast blame widely on the school community, as we know that most of us abhor and condemn acts of hatred. Yet the implications are serious enough that I felt obligated to inform you of this discovery, not to give attention to those who acted inappropriately, but to let them know that their actions have no place in our school community.

If even one member of our community feels unwelcome or distressed by this incident, that is one person too many. All students, families, and staff members must feel equally included and respected by each of us. Hate speech and scare tactics will not be tolerated and do not represent what we stand for. I ask each of you today to recommit to the belief that all of us deserve the opportunity to participate fully in our school community and our society at large and to join together in denouncing acts of hatred and bigotry.

Scarsdale High School’s Dignity, Inclusion, and Belonging Team will have its first meeting of the new school year in a few weeks. The team’s agenda this year includes creating and administering a climate survey and bringing programming to students to enhance our efforts in ensuring an inclusive school community where everyone of diverse backgrounds feels a genuine sense of belonging. This incident will be among the items that team discusses.

Students and families who would like to talk further about this incident should contact their deans or our youth outreach workers. If you have information about this incident, please contact me directly.

Thank you for your attention and consideration.

Sincerely,
Kenneth Bonamo
Principal  The Rabbi condemns the incident and offers support to any individual who feels unsafe or wants to talk about how they feel. Yesterday afternoon, we learned through a letter (included below) sent by Kenneth Bonamo, Principal of Scarsdale High School, of an Anti-Semitic incident at Scarsdale High School in which a swastika was found engraved on a toilet paper dispenser in a school bathroom.

All of us commend Scarsdale High School’s leadership for their swift condemnation of this act of Anti-Semitism, hatred, and intolerance. In the year 2019, no person, young or old, in our community, or anywhere, should be subjected to the language or symbols that the Nazi regime used in the service of violence, terror, and mass murder.

We simply will not stand for it.

I have spoken with Mr. Bonamo to offer WRT’s partnership in responding to this hateful display, which he gratefully received. It is important for our community to know that our institutions stand shoulder-to-shoulder at this time.

Additionally, the clergy of the temple are available to meet with any students or families who would like to discuss the episode and how best to respond to your own questions and concerns, or your children’s questions and concerns. We are also reaching out to the Anti-Defamation League to alert them to the incident. The ADL is a trusted partner in WRT’s own efforts to confront and condemn Anti-Semitism and hate, and to continue to build a congregation and community established on principles of Jewish solidarity, universal human dignity, tolerance, respect, and inclusion.

When I was 16 years old, my family returned from a weekend at the Jersey shore to our home in Allentown, Pennsylvania. The chilling image that greeted us upon our return has never left my memory. As we pulled into the driveway, we saw swastikas painted all over our garage door. Our school district, synagogue, and the ADL collaborated effectively to identify the perpetrators (students in my sister’s eighth grade class), to provide sensitivity training in the school, and to discipline the offenders.

We all share the hope that similarly swift and effective measures will be taken in Scarsdale around this incident, and we stand at the ready to provide support in this shared effort.

During the High Holidays and throughout the year, we look forward to informing you about our ongoing efforts to educate our community about Anti-Semitism and to stand up against it, in all its many forms. Together, we will enter the forthcoming new year in a spirit of shared vigilance, resolve, and fortitude.

“Upon further examination, additional swastikas were discovered in other Staples locations,” Abbey wrote in the email. “In one location several Stars of David were found next to an expletive.”


An extra night crew worked on Thursday to ensure the obscenities were removed by the time school started on Friday.


“We take these acts seriously are actively partnering with the Westport Police Department as we move forward with our investigation,” Abbey said. “In the days ahead we will do everything we can to deter these acts, throughout our district and through our daily efforts, work to create a climate where all are welcomed and valued.” Also a Senator: State Sen. Tony Hwang, R-28, condmened the acts in a statement on Friday.

“When someone becomes the target of a crime because of race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity or disabilitiy, the very fabric and soul of our community is torn,” Hwang said.

He added he was proud to shepherd a bipartisan passage of House Bill 5743 in the 2017 General Assembly session. The act created one of the nation’s strongest hate-crime laws, he said.

“The only way to combat this sort of racism and hate is education, compassion and zero tolerance,” Hwang said. “When the specter of hate rears its ugly head in our communities, all of us will rise up against it.

Murphy then details a number of steps he said the department is taking, including removing the swastika, asking staffers and cleaning personnel if they saw anything ""suspicious,"" notifying the Department of Homeland Security's offices of the inspector general and security, asking the DHS Insider Threat Program ""to take steps as appropriate"" and hearing suggestions ""on steps we may want to take"" from the DHS Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties.

The goal of the assembly is partly “to develop a common language for discussing issues of diversity, name-calling and bullying,” as well as to “provide a forum in which students will feel safe to speak out about issues of diversity, bullying and name-calling.”

On Monday morning, Sept. 9, graffiti with three swastikas was found, made by crayon on a first-floor outside window at the school.

“The ADL has also provided me with a lesson plan and activities discussing hate-symbols, and antiSemitism,” Somers wrote in her email, “which I have presented to the Advisory Committee for immediate implementation.”

DARIENITE.COM EDITORIAL: We feel the attention will increase this kind of graffiti with Nazi symbols, which we can remember from our own time in school 40 and more years ago (and we hope we’re proven wrong). The same childish impulse to say something rude with graffiti is only encouraged when it’s publicized, but sometimes we have to give the public what it wants, and on a rare occasion incidents like these might be a prelude to something worse than graffiti. It’s also true that the school assembly described by Somers could do quite a bit of good (even if it increases graffiti). The lack of response to similar graffiti decades ago likely also have had a cost. There are costs to nearly every benefit: We’ll have to wait to see how this turns out. Here’s the full text of Somers’ email: Good afternoon Middlesex Families. This morning we discovered a swastika and a Star of David etched into a stall in one of our restrooms. Our school resource officer notified the DPD [Darien Police Department], and a detective was dispatched to photograph and document the incident. As part of our ongoing school-wide Social and Emotional Learning, I am scheduling an assembly with the Anti-Defamation League focused on the following goals: To develop a common language for discussing issues of diversity, name-calling and bullying To increase students’ awareness of the dynamics of name-calling and bullying incidents by understanding the different roles people play and the behaviors associated with each To provide a forum in which students will feel safe to speak out about issues of diversity, bullying and name-calling The ADL has also provided me with a lesson plan and activities discussing hate-symbols, and antiSemitism, which I have presented to the Advisory Committee for immediate implementation. I feel that our collaboration with the DPD and our plans to inform and educate our students will put an end to these intolerable acts.

Earlier in the evening, University Housing hosted a round table conversation regarding racism, bias and free speech issues. Gardner said they will schedule a similar conversation at Aggie Village next week.

“This is just the beginning of what we hope will be an engaged process to explore and address these topics as a community as we move through this year,” Gardner wrote.

It's also caused officials to hammer the Starbucks' management in Nyack where the event took place more than three weeks ago, was not reported to police, and the fact that the swastikas were still visible, said Rockland County Executive Ed Day.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo is also outraged that the crime was not reported and the doors are still in the restroom at the coffee shop located at 80 Main St., Nyack.

The governor announced he is directing the state police's hate-crimes Task Force to look into the incident and to punish those responsible to the ""fullest extent of the law.""

""antiSemitism and hate in all its forms are repugnant to New York's values of inclusion, diversity and acceptance - and we will continue to call out cowardly acts of hate whenever and wherever we see them,"" Cuomo said.

Day is especially taking aim at Starbucks who he says failed to report the crime or remove the door. The county executive said on Facebook that the county's Human Rights Commissioner checked to see if the crime and had been reported, and the answer was an unbelievable ""No"". 

""Worse yet, we today confirmed with law enforcement that this happened approximately three weeks ago, was still up in the bathroom today and Starbucks either did not see it or simply did not report it,"" Day said. ""The police are still awaiting a report from Starbucks which we are told is finally forthcoming. Obviously any evidence that may have been obtained with prompt notification to the police has long disappeared.""

Now he is calling on the store's management to justify not notifying the police and for customers to decide if they want to ask the manager about the incident.

The hate-based behavior comes a week after another swastika was found in the boy’s bathroom of the same school.

The latest incident comes days before the celebration of Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year.

The school is unaware of when the antisemitic symbols, which have since been removed, were placed in both locations. They are making the investigation a top priority for the district community, said Superintendent Nicholas Norcia. The Fair Lawn police are investigating both incidents. 

Norcia is urging everyone in the community to continue having conversations around respect and acceptance.

“Hate-based behavior is intolerable and has no place in society and in our schools. The staff of the Fair Lawn Public Schools will continue to promote an environment of inclusiveness for all our students. We will continue to educate our students on the need for respecting one another,” said Norcia in a Facebook post.

Fair Lawn has a curriculum that studies the history of the Holocaust and genocide, the superintendent said. They also have diversity celebrations throughout the school year.

“We are very aware of the rise in antisemitism across the nation since the election in 2016 and we continue to find ways to educate the youth in the community,” said Mayor Kurt Peluso.


During a council meeting in Fair Lawn on Sept. 24, an ordinance was introduced to add a community relations advisory committee. The committee will create educational, cultural, and community programming, that promotes inclusivity.

The committee will address hate behavior. The goal is that they can be more proactive than reactive. One of the first events the committee will organize is an interfaith night, an event that also took place last year in Fair Lawn.

Councilwoman Cristina Cutrone, who is also a teacher, said, “The more we can teach people, we expect to see less things like this happen.”",,school administration,clean up/cover up,"school administration

“The appearance of this despicable symbol is yet another example of the rising tide of antisemitism in our country,” Engel wrote.

Proclamation 32-09, passed by the SGA Senate on Nov. 12 and signed by SGA President Rachel Byers, will prompt SGA work with the Equal Opportunity Office, University Housing and Resident Assistants “to create appropriate educational materials in residence halls.” The materials would include a uniform statement on the campus anti-discrimination policy and instructions for how students can report issues, according to the proclamation.

The UGA Residence Hall Association, which “advocate[s] for the 8,300+ residents that live on campus,” released a statement condemning the actions that lead to the reports.

Last week, a swastika was found in a bathroom in the Foreign Languages Building and another at Taft Hall.

In at least one case, the damage appeared to be quite old, the UI Police said in a statement.

The discovery of a swastika last week, along with a controversial residence hall presentation on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, prompted Chancellor Robert Jones to send a campus-wide email addressing the incidents.

Chancellor Robert Jones apologized after complaints about 'antisemitic content' in a UI Housing diversity training program, calling it 'inexcusable and unacceptable.'

“Bias and prejudice are antithetical to the educational foundations of our university and hurtful to our entire community. The idea that any individual feels threatened for expression of personal religious or ethnic identity is unacceptable,” Jones said in the email.

We followed instructions to await their arrival so as to avoid a confrontation and for everyone’s safety. When the police arrived, the individual was escorted from the restaurant per our instructions.”  Some customers, disturbed by the incident left the restaurant and were later quoted by News12, saying the offender was probably within his First Amendment rights, “but to be that blatant and display that kind of hate in a public place had to be called out.”

“Unfortunately as offensive as his display was, he did not threaten anyone and just sat down to eat,” White Plains Public Safety Commissioner David Chong told the Examiner on Saturday. “The other customers were upset and the owner didn’t want to serve him. We checked his credentials and ran his name through all the intelligence systems. He had no priors and since the property was his own, as offensive as it was, it did not meet the level of a crime. He claimed that it was his constitutional right to free speech and expression and he is correct. After we escorted him out, we forwarded his information to the State Terrorism center,” Chong said.  Millie Jasper, Executive Director of the White Plains-based Holocaust & Human Rights Education Center, said in an interview Sunday that, “when someone wears a swastika, they are putting it out there for everyone to see they are identifying with Nazi ideology.”

Jasper said that while the man said nothing, spoke to no one in the restaurant other than to order food, his intent was clear.

Having borne witness to several acts of antiSemitism over recent weeks, including at area high schools, Jasper said,  “At the Holocaust & Human Rights Education Center, we want to engage in conversation about the evolution of hate and where these ideas and statements about ourselves come from,” indicating that minds can be changed with education.

In March the Center will hold an annual meeting at Iona College with over 600 high school students from 45 schools in Westchester County to address this issue. “You would be surprised how many high school students are on the fence,” Jasper said. “There is a lot of peer pressure out there.”  See also some information on First Amendment stuff.

Police say an officer actually saw the graffiti on his own while out on another call. Berry says it’s clear the mark took some work.

“Somebody had to actually make a stencil to use to paint the thing on the sidewalk,” he said. “Somebody had to put some effort into it. It wasn’t like somebody just walked up there with a spray can.”

The City’s Graffiti Abatement Team, which falls under code enforcement, painted over the image after this story aired. 

“I would think it would be offensive to anybody,” Berry said.

Neither police nor Berry reported any other instances of the Nazi symbol in the area. Arizona’s Family didn’t see any others at the greenbelt, either.

Scottsdale Police said the swastika vandalism could be considered a hate-crime, but that’s something that wouldn’t be determined until a sentencing phase if someone were ever to be convicted of a crime.

Sad news from the UU Church of Cortland, NY,” the Facebook post said. “Last night their church was painted with a swastika. This is a historic building from 1837 that helped support the abolitionist movement.”


The post then asked for “supportive notes” for the church.

More than 250 people shared the message and dozens left heartfelt messages. Many of the messages came from members of other Unitarian Universalist churches in other states, including Oregon, Kentucky, Wisconsin, Florida and Pennsylvania.

On Sunday, Unitarian Universalist Church of Cortland member Autumn Pfister thanked everyone for their words of encouragement in a message posted on the church website:

“Thank you all for your outpouring of love and support! We are grateful for all of your encouraging messages,” Pfister wrote. “The image was shocking to see on our historic church and we are still early in our emotional processing.""

Pfister told supporters in her message that the defacement has been “reported to the police and the hateful image was subsequently painted over by one of our board members.”

She also said other buildings in the area also were vandalized around the same time.

This is the second defacement at a Unitarian Universalist church this month in Central New York.",,community members,victim support,"community members

Dear WMS Community,

It is with deep concern that I share with you that a swastika was found in one of the boys’ bathrooms at the middle school in the evening hours, late last week.  As we continue to investigate, we are unsure of who drew it, but we do feel it was done after school hours when the building was open for evening activities.  Regardless, this act of antiSemitism is something that will not be tolerated in our school and district.  As the building leader, I feel that any act that does not support our values of inclusivity and safety for all, will be strongly addressed by our WPS/WMS administration.  

In response, we will continue to discuss strategies with our community partners from Temple Beth Elohim, consider the timing of our antisemitic curriculum delivered in social studies classes, think of potential educational opportunities from the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), and monitor our building for safety.  I also plan to communicate a message to all students in our school that expresses my concerns and thoughts about antisemitic and racist acts.  We are a caring community at WMS, and I want everyone to be responsible for our feelings of safety and respect that need to be practiced daily.

If you have any information that you feel is important for our school to know, please contact me or one of our assistant principals directly.  Additionally, I hope that you will talk to your children about the incident, as it involves all of us.  As a school, we feel such sorrow and remorse when antisemitic incidents happen, as we work tirelessly to try and prevent them.  That being said, I feel confident in our ability to address — reactively and proactively – those things that negatively impede our school days and greater lives.  We continue to strive for safety for all students at WMS.

Sincerely,

Mark Ito
Principal, Wellesley Middle School             Dear Members of the Wellesley Community,

As we continue to hold diversity, equity, and inclusion as high priorities in the Wellesley Public Schools, we have recently been reminded of the challenges we face in pursuit of these values. Following an athletic competition last week, a WHS athlete was called a racial slur by an athlete from a neighboring community. At the end of the week, we discovered a swastika drawn in a bathroom at Wellesley Middle School. The District has reported both of these incidents to the Wellesley Police Department and the Anti-Defamation League.

Let me be clear that any actions involving language and/or symbols of hate are unacceptable and will not be tolerated in our District.  Each of these incidents also underscores the importance of our continued efforts to ensure that our school community remains a safe and inclusive place for all of our students and staff.

When hate is allowed to grow unchecked, it can lead to tragic consequences. Just one year ago yesterday, a gunman took the lives of eleven worshippers at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. We are clearly not immune from the issues of hate and division that are on the rise in our country.  As we engage with each other and our young people, I ask that all members of our community speak with one, unambiguous voice in support of our core values of Respect for Human Differences, Cooperative and Caring Relationships, and Commitment to Community. 

Thank you,

David F. Lussier, Ed.D.

She said the vandalism has left her sickened and angry.

“These are not just marks on a wall but attacks on our community and the values we hold central to our shared humanity,” she said. “Hate has no place at Smith.”Each has since been covered up, and the campus is working to remove them permanently, the college said.

Smith students, faculty and staff are being asked to notify police if they find any similar graffiti on other locations.

Campus police are also conducting a search of the campus for any more graffiti or similar acts of vandalism.

The school will also be attending to the safety and well-being of the campus community, especially Jewish students and employees. Matilda Cantwell, director of religious and spiritual life at Smith, will be in Helen Hills Hills Chapel Friday until midnight to meet with anyone needing a space to reflect and heal, according to the college.

Cantwell and Rabbi Rhonda Shapiro-Reiser are also supposed to have an announcement Saturday.

McCartney said the vandalism was intended to incite fear and division on campus. Instead, Smith, she said, members of the Smith community will respond “by supporting one another and with our sustained commitment to dismantling the systems from which these abhorrent acts emerge.”",,school administration,letters/statements,"school administration

The meeting being set comes after Schools Superintendent Dr. Alan Addley told The Darien Times a swastika had been recently found at Darien High School on Nov. 1. Details are still being organized for the meeting.

“At the end of the day, a high school student reported finding a swastika drawn on a school Chromebook. The student reported the incident to the high school administration,” he said. Addley said the drawing was likely from the end of the previous school year.                        “Unfortunately, I must inform you of a discovery made late in the day on Friday, Nov. 1 at DHS. A student noticed, and immediately reported, a small swastika drawn in ink on a Chromebook taken from a cart in a science classroom. We are greatly disturbed by this symbol of hatred and are currently investigating.”

“We have determined that the device has not been used since last June and are therefore not certain about the timing of this act. We join the middle school in its message of zero tolerance and their efforts, along with the entire Darien School District, to expand our educational focus on the impact of such symbols on all of us,” she said.

Dunn told families she addressed the school body today with the message and “our work will continue to sustain a school climate in which acts of racism, in any form, are abhorred.”

“As part of this effort, the administration is finalizing a Community Conversation for Action. Leaders in the community will be invited to participate in the conversation that will be hosted and facilitated by the National Conference for Community and Justice,” he said.

Darien High School principal Ellen Dunn sent an email to school families Wednesday, as sent to Darien High School families, in its entirety. “At DHS, we cannot remain silent…we cannot and do not tolerate a symbol of hatred in our community. I ask you all to interfere… to consider your role in rejecting hatred and use your voices to educate, to challenge and to condemn this behavior. I will be meeting with our Community Council and we will invite you all to participate in our work going forward to prevent such acts in our community. There is nothing more important.”

First Selectman Jayme Stevenson said “Our modern world associates the swastika with the German National Socialist (Nazi) party and the military brutality and Holocaust genocide perpetrated by Adolf Hitler and his followers during World War 2.”

“It has become a powerful symbol of hatred, racial bias and antiSemitism. Sadly, several swastika drawings were found in our middle and high schools. I would like to believe these drawings were not expressed with malicious or hateful intention,” she said.

“Darien is a town of loving caring people so these overt symbols of hate are incongruent with what I know and love about our town. We must, however, maintain zero tolerance for all expressions of hate, racial bias and discrimination of any kind in our schools and community,” she said. Stevensons said she strongly encourages families to take time to talk about the importance of tolerance and inclusivity and looks forward to working together with school officials, town and community leaders and in partnership with the the Anti-Defamation League.

“The Darien Board of Education rejects symbols of hate, and supports the Districts efforts to educate our children on the deep, painful, and profound wounds opened by each of these occurrences,” said Board of Education Chairman Tara Ochman.

“We ask the community as a whole, and all families to join us in these tough, real conversations. Darien is a community that has always been brave and outspoken. Let us not shy away from this topic,” Ochman said.

“The Board of Education is committed educating our children on the past, so they can go out into the world and build a brighter future,” she said.

Darien Police said though the school resource officer had been notified about the high school incident, the investigation was being led by the school district.",,school administration,letters/statements,"school administration

“Swastikas are offensive and not condoned in our community,” City Manager Scott Neal said Tuesday. “Incidents such as this do not reflect the sentiments of the community. We must continue to work together to make Edina welcoming for all.”                                                                     School district surveillance video was reviewed, leading officials to a juvenile being identified as the person responsible. The youth was interviewed Tuesday and confessed to the temporary defacing of the property just south of the high school football field and the Edina Community Center, police said.

“Because there was no permanent damage to the school district’s property, there was not a crime with which to charge the juvenile,” a statement from police read.

The mother of two says she contacted the principal and the board of education.

By Wednesday, the carvings were removed which Perel believes was a smart move by the school board.

“These hate-crimes don’t have any room in our schools,” said Perel. “We should be working to create a better learning environment for our children.”

The concerned mother says she wants to educate rather than persecute the person or group of people that may have completed the hateful actions.

“We must know how to act and react in those situations,” said Perel. “It takes a village to educate, nurture and mold the leaders of tomorrow.”

Supervisor Peter Van Scoyoc said in his office afterward that while he believed the spray-painted swastika was the work of juveniles, it was still “troubling, especially if you were of Jewish descent, it would be especially troubling.”

The second incident was also troubling to the supervisor, a Democrat on an all-Democratic board. Councilwoman Sylvia Overby read out a Nov. 11 email from Chief Michael Sarlo that said the department was still investigating both incidents. “We understand how unsettling and disturbing hate-symbols are to the community and we will continue to be diligent in our patrol work to ensure bias and hate have no place in East Hampton,” the chief wrote. Ms. Overby said the town’s anti-bias task force would address the issue as well.

 Mr. Van Scoyoc said that while the first incident appeared to be youth-oriented, the second did not. “To me, it’s probably somebody who feels that, okay, we’re overzealous in some way, we control everything, like the SS or something. I don’t know. That’s the way it feels to me.

“Hateful symbols, language, is very disturbing in our community. We’re a very inclusive community, and we need to push back against this type of expression of hate,” he added.

 Ms. Overby said it was hard for her to comprehend such hate in the community. “I’m aghast at this kind of level. It’s not part of how I feel about this community. It’s hard for me to wrap my head around it and have a coherent response.

Door 2115, located on the second floor of Buchanan Hall, had a swastika etched into it – which has since been removed and re-stained. The door has no evidence of the marking besides a slight discoloration where the stain is.

“ISU Police are investigating the swastika vandalism and the Department of Residence is offering support and resources to all residents on the impacted floor of Buchanan Hall,” Wintersteen said in an email. “The vandalism, stickers and posters are being removed in accordance with university policy.”

Buchanan residents received an email from Kirsten Hauge, Buchanan Hall Director, offering them the opportunity for support and to talk about the incident.

“One of our main responsibilities as residence life staff within the Buchanan community is ensuring that we’re creating an inclusive living-learning environment for all of our residents and guests,” Hauge said in an email. “Recently, we became aware of a 1-inch by 1-inch swastika carved in the second floor den door. The swastika was reported to ISUPD, documented and removed from the door.”",,school administration,letters/statements,"school administration

Wilson reported the incident to the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD). 

“MPD responded immediately that day,” Martin said. “For a few days after, there was an increased police presence at the school.” The school used the Incident Reporting Tool to inform other DC agencies.   The Wilson Jewish Student Union (JSU) expressed its sadness and anger at the situation. “I don’t think it’s solely the JSU’s job to condemn these acts, [but rather] it’s our job to teach students about Judaism,” JSU co-president Zoe Zitner said. “It all relates to the lack of an adequate Holocaust education at schools—students don’t know the history behind the swastikas, what they mean and the amount of hate behind them.”  The vandalism was a main discussion point in a Diversity Task Force meeting that took place on December 5. At the meeting, Martin discussed the acts of vandalism and others provided ideas for how to approach the situation. Those in attendance included representatives from the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) and the Director for the Mayor’s Office for Religious Affairs.  The Diversity Task Force meeting sought to address ways in which Wilson could respond and prevent future expressions of hate and antisemitism. Magner suggested a lesson plan that would aim to educate people about antisemitic acts and why they happen. “It’s a lesson plan called ‘Swastikas and Other hate-symbols.’ The purpose of the lesson plan is to fill in those blanks about what exactly [hate-symbols are],” Magner said.

Magner concluded the meeting by emphasizing the importance of communication in the wake of hate-filled events. “This is why it is important to have a conversation.”",,police/sheriff,other,"police/sheriff

“I saw him, and I grabbed him and I said, ‘Look!’,” Ms. Bell said. “Then I just followed up with an email about it.”

Administration expressed dismay about the incident. 

“Anything in this building that creates an unwelcoming atmosphere and that is hurtful towards any group of people in the building is deeply concerning to me,” Principal Dr. Marmor said.  “This particular symbol has very deep rooted hatred and a very deep rooted meaning and is particularly offensive to many people, including myself. I was certainly not happy to have seen it there.”

In response, and as part of the investigation, every student with classes in Room 102 had their notebooks inspected on November 22 and November 25 to see if swastikas were drawn.

“In this particular case, we canvassed those rooms with those kids and took a quick peek at some of their writings to see if there was any similar or suspicious activity,” Dr. Marmor said. “We did not find anything specific, or suspicious.” 

Ms. Bell stated that the school is planning to have No Place for Hate come in and speak with the classes as a response to the incident. No Place for Hate is an initiative pushed by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) to, according to the ADL website, promote “unity and respect, and empowering schools to reduce bullying, name-calling and other expressions of bias.”",,school administration,letters/statements,"school administration

“A hate-crime such as this is hurtful, unacceptable and will not be tolerated,” Townsend wrote in her letter, which was written in both English and Spanish.According to Montgomery County School District Spokesperson Gboyinde Onijala, the incident is under investigation.

When the swastika was found, both the Montgomery County Police (MCP) Department and the school district’s Office of School Support and Improvement were notified.                                          Guila Franklin Siegel, associate director of the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Washington (JCRC), called the most recent incident “disturbing.”

A swastika is not just antisemitic, she said. It also denotes “white nationalism, white power and racism,” she said.

It also could be a middle school student “who just wants to get a rise out of people,” she said.

Hate-based vandalism, bullying and discrimination “is taking place” not just locally, but across the country, she said.

There has been “an uptick” in calls to the JCRC from parents and other residents who report on an incident they or their child experienced, she said.

The JCRC works within the school district, performing outreach to administration, staff, students and parents.

“We have done numerous teacher trainings,” she said. “We help teachers address implicit and explicit bias in the classroom, but more is needed.”",,school administration,letters/statements,"school administration

“A symbol like this, which definitely has hateful connotations, is still a protected form of free speech on the homeowner's own property,” he said.


Nonverbal, non-written forms of communication like flag burning, wearing arm bands and burning draft cards, are also forms of symbolic speech protected by the First Amendment provided they do not cause a specific, direct threat to a person or to the public.

She said the administrator who discovered the swastikas, as well as several Jewish students, were appalled by the defacement. “It’s not to be tolerated,” she said.

Statement backed by many local leaderss:

The statement reads:

While any vandalism damages the fabric of our community, expressions of hate threaten to tear it apart.

antisemitic symbols have no place in Santa Barbara County or in the Santa Ynez Valley. Not here, not now, not ever. We condemn all acts of antiSemitism, all forms of bigotry, bullying, and hate.

It is incongruous that such a symbol would appear on the campus of Santa Ynez Valley Union High School, which focuses on and promotes educating students to live in our multi-cultural region and world, with people from many racial, ethnic, and religious backgrounds.

The use of such a harmful symbol as the swastika, which represents a genocidal attack on the Jewish people, is an act of aggression and hate that has no place in our vibrant, diverse, and welcoming community. Local teachers, parents, and community leaders need to build awareness of the oppression of and violence against Jewish people worldwide and ensure that acts like this never happen here again.

This is an opportunity for us to affirm that our Santa Ynez Valley is a safe and inclusive community, where all people are welcome and images and actions like this are not acceptable. We come together to say our community is better than this and to wish all of you a holiday season filled with love and joy.

Interesting note about how school referred to incident differently than Police dept. Also, 20th swastika reported since Nov. 2018!! The media is counting... Albert Leonard Principal John Barnes sent an email to parents at 2:20 p.m. to inform the school community that an “act-of-hate was discovered today toward the back of our school blacktop.” “During our 8th grade lunch, a student upstander brought something written on the blacktop to the attention of one of our security monitors,” wrote Barnes. “The school notified our local authorities of the antisemitic language discovered, and filed a police report.” 8th grade lunch is 11:03 a.m. to 11:51 a.m. “We are working with our local authorities and district officials to investigate this horrific and disturbing act.” “We work to promote an inclusive, accepting environment for all of our school constituents and will not tolerate any incidents that spread hate, injustice, or an unsafe learning environment,” said Barnes. The school asked parents to contact school officials if they or their children were aware of any specifics and had any information. In response to an exclusive report of four Swastikas found past month at New Rochelle High School published by Talk of the Sound later the same day as the Albert Leonard MS incident, December 10th, the District issued a statement from Superintendent Dr. Laura Feijóo. “We recognize this type of graffiti as an act-of-hate,” said Feijóo. “We will identify those responsible so that they may face appropriate consequences, and to address underlying social and emotional issues that would cause a child to act out in this fashion.”","The incident marks the twentieth Swastika reported to New Rochelle Police since November 2018, including four last month, at three public schools: New Rochelle High School, Albert Leonard Middle School and Isaac E.

Last week, the school sent out two emails informing parents of the situation. The second email, from school Principal Adam Camacho, included a copy of the statement teachers read to students that day during second period classes. “It is with great sadness and concern that we as a staff share with you that as of early this morning SDA’s community has suffered a recent rash of vandalism and destructive activities,” read the teacher’s statement to students. “Foul and homophobic language, disturbing antisemitic imagery, including swastikas, have been drawn on and photoshopped images taped to restroom walls. These images are being shared through text and social media. These symbols and language reflect intolerance and hate, and they have provoked heartbreak and disappointment in our community.” The statement went on to read: “SDA is an inclusive family, a welcoming place where each student should feel safe at all times. We have all worked diligently to create a culture of acceptance and tolerance. This graffiti is not representative of our school community and we condemn it in no uncertain terms.” The statement said administration is working closely with students, staff, campus supervisors, as well as external resources, including the Encinitas Sheriff’s Department, to identify the offender(s) and hold them accountable. The statement ended by urging anyone who knows anything to come forward, to share with a trusted adult, submit a tip to WeTip.com, or drop a note in the “Kids That Care” box in the Mustang Commons. “Do the right thing,” it read. “Do not allow hate and intolerance to supersede love and acceptance. One person of integrity can make a difference. We are here for you.” See article for more on community response including statement by Tammy Gillies, regional director of the Anti-Defamation League in San Diego. “It is very disturbing and at this point we don’t know what the intention was of the perpetrator, so we don’t know if this was a hate crime or what it was, yet,” Gillies said Dec. 17 about the vandalism. “But it’s not so much about the intention, I think, as it is about the impact that it has on the community. Students and teachers feeling uncomfortable and unsafe going to school, because if you’re one of those groups that you hear has been targeted that’s not a safe school climate for you to want to go to.”

Gillies said she believes that before the winter break SDA will be putting out a statement of some programming they plan to do when the students get back and “address this in a way that’s most helpful for everyone and creating that school environment that people want to be in.”",,school administration,letters/statements,"school administration

“Majority Leader Laurie Cumbo denounces any instance of racism, antiSemitism, and hate in all of its various forms.  It is particularly disheartening when these hateful-messages are placed on or close to school property where our children and young people are supposed to be safe, and where we shape young minds for the future. There should be no place for hate in Brooklyn and especially in the halls of our public schools.”

Mayor de Blasio tweeted a response:  (see article)


This is New York, and we have absolutely zero tolerance for such acts of intolerance and bigotry. When you attack one of us, you attack all of us, and we will stand united with the Jewish community to condemn these illegal acts and eradicate this cancer of hate.

I am directing the State Police hate-crimes Task Force to assist the NYPD in their investigation to ensure the person responsible for this vile act is held accountable to the fullest extent of the law. Racism, antiSemitism and other forms of intolerance are repugnant to New York values. We will fight back every time they rear their ugly head, and we will win because we are right and we know diversity is and always will be our greatest strength.”

hate-crimes against the Jewish community in Brooklyn have been happening at a frightening clip as of late, including the recent reports of swastikas found at Trump Village and in Greenpoint, as well as a number of assaults. Brooklyn residents and politicians have begun significantly ramping up efforts to address and cut down on these incidents.

“I am disgusted by the reports of swastikas and hateful language found written inside a car that was broken into in Queens this morning,” Cuomo said. “These blatant antisemitic acts are meant to instill fear and feed the cancer of hate that has become pervasive across this nation in recent years.”

Despite overall crime hitting a record low in 2019, hate-crimes were on the rise this past year. antisemitic hate-crimes were the driver for the increase, according to the NYPD.

Rodolico said he was confident that the person who made the pro-Trump sign, or any person who supports Trump, did not vandalize the sign.

""Ledyard is an open, accepting community. All signs of hate in our community must be challenged and, if considered by our police force to be a hate-crime, justice must prevail,"" said Wood. ""Silence is, in effect, acceptance or approval of abhorrent behavior. When left unchallenged, hate persists and grows.""

Wood warned that hate speech can escalate to harassment, threats, or physical violence and make Ledyard residents feel unsafe or unwelcome.

""Hate speech and crimes not only cause many community members to feel angry, frightened, or unsafe, especially marginalized citizens, they damage the whole community,"" said Wood. State Rep. Christine Conley, D-Groton, posted a photo of the sign on Facebook with her statement of outrage, writing that she was ""horrified and embarrassed"" by the vandalism.

""Swastikas are no laughing matter; it symbolizes hatred, bigotry, and exclusion,"" she said. ""We as a community need to be better and ensure something like this never happens again.""

State Sen. Catherine Osten, D-Sprague, issued a statement Monday, acknowledging that another sign within her jurisdiction had recently been vandalized with another anti-Semitic image.

""This symbol represents hate, violence and discrimination; for it to be near a high school is a sobering reminder of how pervasive anti-Semitism remains. We must fight back against hatred in all its forms,"" she said.","The Pro-Trump message may have been a reference to Congressman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., a prosecutor in President Donald Trump's impeachment trial.

The president has expressed interest to Hughey about implementing education about antiSemitism into the fraternity.

“I truly don’t believe that one kid should be a representation of a whole group, in this case, because [the fraternity member] acted alone,” MSU Chabad Vice President Maverick Levy told the Jewish News. “However, it is crucial for us to use this incident to show the recent rise of antiSemitism in our community and allow for this to be an educational tool.”

Bayer stated in the Friday letter.   Bayer noted that the school seeks to educate students around human rights issues through academic classes and school activities.

“In the last year, we have also partnered with the Holocaust and Human Rights Education Center of White Plains to further educate students about the history of antiSemitism and the meaning, purpose, and effect of hate-symbols,” he said. “In addition, each year we work to achieve recognition as a No Place For Hate through the Anti-Defamation League. While we do not believe that incidents like this are representative of our larger student body, we know we must continue to find ways to engage our students in important conversations so that they are empowered to stand up against such expressions of hatred.”

The principal also called on parents to talk to their children about “the values we share as an inclusive community.”

He said parents should remind their children “that each of us has a responsibility to contribute to a culture of understanding and respect.”

“I just worry for minority students on campus who are worried about all of the incidents on campus about white supremacy, and they’re not really being told about it. I wouldn’t want to just find out about that stuff through Twitter. I want to know that the University is taking actual systemic action against it,” Holzhauer said. 

Following the incident, the participants of the hijacked I-Connect meeting received a detailed email from Ross Wantland, the University’s director of diversity and social justice education. In the message, Wantland passed along the statement of the students who were facilitating the meeting:

“As the facilitators that were in charge of the workshops tonight, we want to personally reach out to say we are sorry that all of you had to witness this tonight. This was something that no one should have had to go through. We hope no one feels this unsafe or shocked in a university-sanctioned space again. To the people who were defending us against disruptors, thank you. To those who were just trying to have a normal workshop, thank you. To the people who were shocked and confused by what happened, and maybe even personally affected or triggered, we are standing in support of you and we are here for you.”

The students who attended the I-Connect meeting will still receive credit despite the workshops ending early. The incidents in the three separate meetings have been reported to the University’s Office of Student Conflict Resolution and Bias Assessment Response Team.

“It’s important that the University doesn’t treat this like it’s an isolated incident,” Holzhauer said. “I just got here this year, and I can think of now three different incidents of white supremacy on this campus. The noose in Allen hall, the swastikas on the side of the building and now there are neo-Nazis infiltrating a workshop on inclusion and diversity.”

“I think that without recognizing that this is a pattern of white supremacy, it’s just going to act as the Band-Aid over a way bigger issue.”","On Monday night, during three prescheduled I-Connect meetings held over the Zoom teleconferencing software, multiple individuals bombarded the groups in a seemingly coordinated virtual hijack, bearing swastikas and shouting racial slurs.

""Over the past couple of days, a photo has circulated on social media of swastika graffiti painted on two tree trunks in Pine Ridge Park in Edmonds. In addition, a dressed-up doll was found wedged in the branches of one of the trees. For passers-by, this was a shocking sight and has raised questions and concerns.

""As we all know, the swastika has been used for decades as a symbol of white supremacy and/or hatred towards other races and ethnicities. While we do not know if this incident was motivated by prejudice or hatred, or meant to intimidate, the presence of the swastika graffiti in our public park is very concerning and has no place in our community.

""At the core of the City’s values is for Edmonds to be an open, affirming and inclusive community – an example to other communities in our region. And I believe we fulfill that value promise most every day in our activities, actions, and interactions. Yet, there is always more we can accomplish. There is always more work to do to achieve our goal of a fully equitable and inclusive city.

""Whether purposeful or out of mischief, invoking such a powerful symbol as the swastika, infused with a history of hatred and violence, cannot be condoned. Hateful symbols should not be the subject of anyone’s public expression. We must take a stand against such abuse whenever and wherever we see it.

""Upon discovering this incident, the Edmonds Police Department investigated, took pictures, and interviewed observers, as well as forwarded the incident to federal law enforcement. I have instructed the Parks Department to do their best to remove or obscure the graffiti in this incident to ensure that the trails in Pine Ridge Park remain an inviting, natural respite within our urban environment. Members of the public are encouraged to report incidents of offensive graffiti/hate speech/vandalism to the Edmonds Police Department.

Other online commentators noted with dismay that a similar incident occurred in Santee only last weekend.

That’s extremely tragic. One of Farmington’s zip codes has the second-most cases in the state, more cases in one zip code than the number of cases in counties with many more times the population of Farmington. A gathering like that is incredibly dangerous. People gathering recklessly will spread the virus and needlessly endanger themselves and others. Forty-four percent of people who are infected with COVID-19 receive the virus from someone who is asymptomatic, meaning they do not know they are sick. I understand that people are frustrated with the economic effects of the pandemic – but in order to reopen safely we must continue to control the spread of COVID-19. I am absolutely disgusted by the use of Nazi imagery and rhetoric in discussing the essential actions that have been taken by the governor to slow the spread of this deadly virus and save lives. I truly don’t have the words for people who think that it’s acceptable to take public health policy implemented to protect them and their community and compare it to mass genocide. It’s horrifying. The facts are very ​clear – the governor’s actions have slowed the spread of COVID-19 in New Mexico and saved lives, as simple as that, whether or not people want to believe in the science or not. I encourage those making comparisons to a genocidal dictatorship to stay home in order to keep slowing the spread of COVID-19 and read a history book. The executive director of the Jewish Federation of New Mexico told News 13 “it’s disgusting suggesting that the extreme atrocities committed by the Nazis against 6 million Jews and 6 million others in any way related to the public policy during the COVID-19 crisis.” You can read his full statement below: We would not be available for an on-camera response, but I would like to offer this statement on the record as Executive Director of the Jewish Federation of New Mexico: “While people will disagree about how to balance the necessity for mandated public health standards during COVID-19 and the serious impact these measures have upon small business and the economy, the utilizing of images suggesting any connection to the Nazi regime as a form of political rhetoric only inflames people across our community. More importantly, using such images and references to concentration camps creates a false and offensive moral equivalency by suggesting that the extreme atrocities committed by the Nazis against 6 million Jews and 6 million others is in any way related to public policy during the COVID-19 crisis.

He was told management would take care of the graffiti.

On the evening of June 7, the offensive images had been covered over, he said.

“I checked back this morning,” Miller said. “Within 48 hours, it’s been completely covered up, which to me makes me feel good supporting them, knowing that they want to make sure that hatred is taken care of quickly.”Marcy Paul, director of the Jewish community relations council of the Jewish Federation of Dayton, said she learned of the graffiti in the morning of June 8 and emailed Beavercreek Mayor Bob Stone.

He answered within the hour, which pleased her.

“It is my understanding that the area affected has been or is to be painted, either by the owners of The Greene, or by a local arts center that desires to paint a mural,” Stone wrote her. “I’m certain an update will be soon to follow.”

Paul said she hoped Olshan Properties, the owner of The Greene Town Center, would file a police report so the incident would be logged by the Anti-Defamation League as an antisemitic incident.

“In my role at JCRC, we had just put out a statement regarding the murder of George Floyd,” she told the CJN June 9. “I’m very much intent on being on top of these issues and then following up. So, if there are issues of antiSemitism or other acts of hate in our community and I’m notified about it, I’m going to act.”

Paul also said she did not think a mural would help prevent graffiti.

“Any act of violence is a threat,” Paul said. James Pasch, regional director of the ADL in Cleveland, spoke out about the incident.”It is abhorrent that people would spray paint swastikas by The Greene Town Center,” he wrote in a text to the CJN. “We are, however, inspired by the prompt actions taken by so many. We commend Lake Miller who, in the face of hate, did not remain silent. Likewise, we commend The Greene’s management who promptly removed the graffiti. They, Marcy Paul, and those offering to transform the defaced space into a work of art, are all exemplifying tikkun olam, repairing the world.”","Miller said the experience of seeing the graffiti reminded him of his impulse to hide public displays of his religious identity.

“I didn’t realize when I called out this graffiti that it would be such a public thing, but I think it’s important that people from this community, and every community … realize these things are happening,” he said. “I’ve always had the battle that I think a lot of Jewish people do, of like, if I’m wearing a Jewish star, do I wear it under my shirt, or out and proud? I was always one of those people who – I may be ashamed to say this – but who wore my Jewish star under my shirt because I was afraid of that one person who might say something to me and tear me down.

“Unfortunately, it was like a reminder seeing that, seeing those swastikas there, that those people still exist – people who would try to tear me down simply because of my religious belief.”",business owner,clean up/cover up,"business owner

 Dean of Diversity and Inclusion wrote letter and issues to faculty and students and staff--see here for letter: https://news.wisc.edu/letter-nazi-graffiti-on-grainger-hall/ The following letter was sent on June 18 via email to students, faculty and staff in the Wisconsin School of Business.

WSB students, faculty and staff,

We received a report of a bias incident outside Grainger Hall on Thursday, June 18. Specifically, a column at the entrance of University Avenue/Park Street had graffiti displaying a swastika on it.

The Wisconsin School of Business and University of Wisconsin–Madison condemn the use of this hateful symbol. We value a diverse community where all members are able to participate fully as students and employees. This includes feeling safe, welcomed, valued, and supported.

UW–Madison responds to all reported incidents and may pursue disciplinary action if the behavior violates university policy, including the student conduct code. In this case, criminal charges may also apply.

UWPD is investigating and UW Facilities Planning & Management has removed the graffiti.

We are sorry to have to relay this unfortunate information during an already difficult time. We understand that an incident such as this may impact you. Please note these resources:

If you have information about this incident, please call UWPD at (608) 264-COPS.

Darrell Issa for the vacant 50th Congressional District seat that includes Alpine, said: “The latest sickening display of intolerance and antiSemitism in our community breaks my heart and is one I condemn in the strongest possible terms. But it sadly proves that hate in 2020 is not only alive and well among a cowardly few, but that it has become even more brazen and blatant.”

He said it’s no surprise when some leaders encourage it, retweet it and “cheer on those who advertise intolerance” in an effort to intimidate law-abiding Americans.

“This type of racist fanaticism has oozed out of the gutter and polluted our community too many times in the recent past,” said Campa-Najjar, himself the target of anti-Muslim attacks in his 2018 race against resigned Rep. Duncan D. Hunter. (Campa-Najjar is Christian.) “If we expect to stop bigotry, we need (to) stop electing people who refuse to call racism, antiSemitism and bigotry by its real name.”

John B. Franklin, chief adviser to Republican Issa, said via email Friday that his office hadn’t gotten reports of this yet.

“You are the first to give publicity to this hate monger as far as we know,” he wrote.

Franklin quoted Issa as saying: “Displaying the swastika is morally repugnant, hateful and disgusting.”",,representative/senator,letters/statements,"representative/senator

Additionally, Gov. Cuomo has directed the New York State Police hate crimes task force to investigate hateful graffiti.

“I am disgusted by the swastikas and other racist graffiti that were found in several locations in the town of Perinton Thursday morning,” Gov. Cuomo said in a statement. “This hateful language was written by cowards who only seek to divide and instill fear in our communities, and we have zero tolerance for it in New York. I am directing the State Police Hate Crimes Task Force to investigate this horrific incident and ensure those responsible are held accountable to the fullest extent of the law. New York has been and always will be a beacon of diversity and acceptance, and we will continue to stand united in condemning these vile acts of hate whenever and wherever we see them.”

Responding deputies expressed similar disgust over what transpired in this neighborhood.

“This offends me, it makes me mad to be personally honest with you; all it is is seeking to spread hate,” said Capt. Andrew DeLyser of the Monroe County Sheriff’s Office. “We will do everything that we possibly can to find who did this and file any and all possible charges against this.”

Capt. DeLyser asked for the community’s help with the investigation.

“We need to work together as a community, not only to discourage this time of rhetoric, but also to help us in this investigation to lead us to an arrest,” he said. “Anybody who has something, please reach out to us. This is very, very important to us; we’re dedicating a lot of man power to finding out who did this. If anybody has anything, please — if you have a home security system please check your video, if you have any questions we’ll look at it. Even if you have no information about what happened today, talk with your friends and family and neighbors about how unacceptable this is.”

Monroe County Sheriff’s Office officials said this Thursday in regards to the investigation:

“MCSO is seeking surveillance video from Whitney Rd./Perinton homeowners & neighbors residing in neighborhoods between Watson & Baird Rds. Anyone who has video depicting suspicious individuals or suspicious activity between 07/01/20 at 10 p.m. – 07/02/20 at 6 a.m. is encouraged to call 911.”

Capt. DeLyser said whoever was responsible for the graffiti is not a true member of the community.

“This isn’t us and whoever did this is not a true member of our community, because a true member of our community wouldn’t do something like this,” he said. “This isn’t a spray-painted curse word on the side of the road, this is something that represented hatred, death and the greatest national tragedy in United States history, is what these words represent.

“I don’t know which could be worse, ignorance of what those words mean, or knowing what they mean and putting them up there,” Capt. Delyser said.

Many of these families have made Rochester, and specifically The Pines of Perinton, their home as new Americans.

This is no way to treat the refugee community who has fled war.This is no way to treat anyone.”“This graffiti is meant to terrorize. This isn’t a ‘prank.’ It is meant to instill fear in those whosimply want to live in a peaceful affordable community, and live the American dream,” Smith said.“Our wartime ally community is grateful that the governor is taking immediate action on thisinvestigation.”",Spree: swastikas found in two different locations but linked to the same night.,police/sheriff,other,"police/sheriff

Kim said this is the most recent pain her district has seen, but not the first.

“This is serious, and the repercussions for what it does to a community is real. It’s raw,” she said. The Midstate’s entire interfaith community was also ready to get “stamping,” on Tuesday. More than a dozen congregations condemned the vandalism in a joint statement. Rabbi Elisha Friedman expressed his gratitude in one of his own saying:

“The perpetrator(s) hoped to sow division and fear, but through the overwhelming outpouring of so many coming forward to express their support and friendship for our synagogue and the broader Jewish community, what was intended to divide and alienate us and make us feel unwelcome and scared, failed miserably and instead reminded us of what a strong and loving community we are part of.” candelight vigil to be held on Wed.",,police/sheriff,other,"police/sheriff

“I have learned that the city-sponsored day laborer Center on North Lake Avenue was the target of hateful graffiti,” he said.

“Pasadena has largely been spared from the uptick in hate crimes, but when it does happen, we must condemn it in the strongest possible terms,” Tornek said. “Our City’s strength is sustained by our diversity, so when one group is targeted we all suffer. We will not tolerate this behavior.”

National Day Laborer Organizing Network Co-Executive Director Pablo Alvarado took to social media two express outrage.

“We don’t know the intentions of the individuals who did it but we want to take it serious, particularly in this moment in the history of our country,” he wrote in a Facebook post left a discussion board dedicated to Pasadena politics.

“We have asked our elected officials to denounce it and to send a clear message to everyone: there is no place for bigotry in our city. We ask Mr. Terry Tornek and Councilmember Victor Gordo, to unequivocally denounce this act of hate.”

Reached for comment, Councilmember Victor Gordo said, “Hate, and symbols of hate, must be rejected and denounced wherever they occur, especially in our city.

“I reject this and know that all people in Pasadena do as well,” he continued. “There is no room in this city for this.”

Alvarado said the NAACP Pasadena Branch had reach out in support and he thanked its leadership.

“Our organization will continue to fight for an inclusive, just, equal, and prosperous city,” according to Alvarado. “Our center will continue to supply our beautiful city with the labor it needs to keep the gardens green, the buildings painted, and the houses clean, among other things. The best way to support our center is by calling and hiring the workers.”",mural on day labor center shows people of color working,police/sheriff,other,"police/sheriff

Many of you have seen the pictures of what was done to our monument of the 10 Commandments and the severe damage that was inflicted on our statue of our Blessed Mother. These events have caused no small amount of sadness, anger, and frustration not only within our parish community but within the larger community outside of Citrus Heights and the Universal Catholic Church as well. As justified and understandable as the emotions are, we need to maintain our balance, our perspective and understanding of their importance in the greater scheme of what is happening within our community, our nation, and the world. Both our statue of our Blessed Mother and the monument of the 10 Commandments are important to us because of what they represent for us. In and of themselves they hold value only because of the skill and labor of the artist who created them, carved them out of stone. Outside of our Judeo-Christian heritage they would hold no value; they are simply objects with little or no meaning. It would seem the individual(s) responsible for this heinous act is unaware of the true value of these objects. They are for us valued symbols of various aspects of our salvation history, and therefore priceless! Balance, perspective and understanding: “God Grant me the Serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the Courage to change the things I can and the Wisdom to know the difference”. “God Grant me the Serenity to accept the things I cannot change.” We cannot change the fact this has happened. We can, however, choose how we respond to this. It is an opportunity for prayer and forgiveness rather than frustration and anger. Let us thank our Lord we were able to quickly respond to the damage by repairing our statue and removing the graffiti from the 10 commandments and allowing things to return to a sense of normalcy as quickly as possible. “The courage to change the things I can.” We have a responsibility to care for the material goods of our parish. We were not able to foresee or prevent this horrible act from occurring, but we now have the responsibility to do our utmost to prevent it from happening in the future. We are currently beginning the process of gathering proposals for the installation of security cameras on the property and the construction of a fence, similar to the fence that was installed to ensure the safety of our students when we had the school. Needless to say, both projects will incur a serious financial burden on our parish at a time when we are seeing a 40-50% reduction in donations in support of our parish. As a point of reference, when we installed the fence around the school, over 10 years ago, it had a price tag of over $40,000. Many would ask if we can fund this through our Legacy campaign, which is a legitimate question. It will be a question for Fr. Enrique and our Finance Council to work through. Please know that the Legacy Fund is primarily committed for the renovation of the church. To do otherwise could be problematic. Although these projects might be considered, by the Finance Council, as part of the whole renovation plan, it then raises the importance of supporting our Legacy Fund for the renovation of the church. This presents us with the opportunity to make a commitment, a 4 year pledge, to the Legacy Fund if we haven’t already made a pledge. For those who have already made a pledge, they might want to give some prayerful thought to the possibility of increasing that pledge. The best solution would be for us, the parishioners of Holy Family, to step up and make a financial commitment to make this happen now, not years from now. We now know the threat is very real and very NOW! If we wish to protect the sacredness of our worship space and the safety of those who worship here, then this is now our responsibility. These threats will not go away. Our only recourse is to do everything we can to prevent them from happening again. Together, as a family, as a Holy Family, let us be united with Fr. Enrique to join him in prayer for the conversion of the hearts of the person or persons who would do this, who would seek to add to the sorrows in our world and bring pain to those who have done them no harm. Actions of this sort are likely born of inner pain for which we must have compassion. Each of us must remember that our Faith is not in statues or images. Our Faith is in the Eternal God, in Jesus Christ, His Risen Son, and in the redemption of the Resurrection. While these statues have been cleaned and repaired, they are merely reminders of our Faith, which is stronger and longer lasting than stone. We are happy and proud to practice this, our faith, through the sacramental action of the Church, the Church that Jesus Christ left us here on earth as a means of reaching our salvation. May our Lord Jesus Christ bless you, embracing you in his peace as together we journey through these troubled times united in each other in Christ Jesus… one body, one Spirit, one Lord and Father of all…",,business owner,letters/statements,"business owner

I'm outraged and upset by a cowardly act of what appears to be a racially motivated attack on a home and vehicle of an African American family in Warren. This attack occurred yesterday evening. This is completely unacceptable and will NOT be tolerated in our city. The Warren Police Department and Commissioner Bill Dwyer are on the job and will conduct a complete investigation. Those found responsible for this crime will be brought to justice. Our city is a true melting pot of many different races and religions. All help to make Warren a good community. They are all welcome but those who would peddle hate and cause destruction are NOT welcome in Warren and should be aware that our city leadership and myself in particular will never stop in pursuit of justice. Anyone, who might have additional information about the perpetrator or perpetrators of this crime feel free contact Warren Police (586) 574-4877, my office at (586) 574-4520 or me personally. Thank You! Note: This is NOT reflective of the true character of Warren residents and I'm sure they all share in my outrage.
The Warren City Council also responded to the incident in a statement saying, ""The Warren City Council wishes to express their deep concern for the destructive crimes committed against the Hall family on the evening of Wednesday, September 9, 2020. We are truly distressed such behavior would be perpetrated against any member of our community. The Warren City Council believes diversity makes our community stronger and inclusion of all who reside in Warren make the city a better place for all to live.

The Warren City Council wishes to condemn these acts of intimidation, destruction, and violence. We offer our heartfelt sympathies to the Hall family and pledge our full support to the Warren Police Department in their efforts to bring those responsible to justice.""","Black American couple has BLM sign in the window of home; tires slashed, large rock thrown through window of home",police/sheriff,other,"police/sheriff

The Chattanooga Police Department is investigating and I have every confidence that the vandals will be identified and brought to justice soon.

""While we do not know the intent of those who perpetrated this act, we know that the end result if residents feeling less comfortable in their home. Our city is resolved to condemn anyone who seeks to intimidate or foment violence against any ethnic or religious group.

""Our Public Works crews will be working this Sunday to remove these symbols of hate from our bridges and walls. Our entire community will continue to work, day after day, year after year, to make it clear that these kinds of destructive acts and attitudes have no place here.""mayor and official with community relations committee issued statements, as did executive director of Jewish Federation and local rabbi. Officials with the Community Relations Committee, a representative body from the Jewish Federation of Greater Chattanooga, said, ""We are disturbed and saddened to find Nazi swastikas painted on the Walnut Street Bridge and in the Bluff View Arts District in Chattanooga this morning.  The swastika, an antisemitic symbol, has become representative of white supremacy and hate groups around the world. As a united Chattanooga Jewish community, we stand against all forms of hate.  As a faith community, as good citizens and as Americans, we condemn this act of antisemitism in the strongest of terms.  Hate against one is hate against all.""
Michael Dzik, executive director of the Jewish Federation said, “It’s a surreal feeling to see acts of antisemitism in my hometown.  I take this and any act of antiSemitism and all forms of hate very seriously. I have always known that the Nazi swastika and white supremacy go hand in hand.  Although unsettling and disturbing, this only gives the Jewish community more resolve to continue fighting against hate.  Additionally, we will continue building bridges of friendship with all peoples and all communities.  I am confident that the Jewish community does not stand alone in this effort to eliminate antisemitism and all forms of hate; we are stronger together.”
Rabbi Craig Lewis of Chattanooga’s Mizpah Congregation said, “I would like to thank the city of Chattanooga for taking swift action to repair the damage and for providing assurances for our protection. Sadly, we have seen this before with swastikas used to frighten and intimidate. While the swastika has become a universal symbol of prejudice, it holds a very specific meaning for the Jewish people who saw six million of its own people murdered under the Nazi banner. It is especially troubling at this time as we are on the cusp of the Jewish new year. As we enter into a period of reflection and atonement, we invite the entire community of Chattanooga to join us in considering how to foster an environment of acceptance and equality for all.” 
Austin Center, chairman of the Jewish Federation’s Community Relations Committee said, “Having lived in Chattanooga my whole life, and hearing the news today that someone painted Swastikas on the Walnut Street Bridge and the Arts District made me sick to my stomach.  We, as a Jewish community, spoke out when the Rock on University of Tennessee’s campus was painted with antisemitic remarks. We spoke out when Nashville’s Holocaust Memorial was desecrated.  And today, in my hometown, we speak out.  Our history is built on overcoming the odds and working to better our community.  As we condemn these acts of hate, let us each strive to teach others acts of kindness and respect.”",,police/sheriff,other,"police/sheriff

I joined Hempstead Town Supervisor Don Clavin, members of the Town Board at the Seamans Neck Park playground to condemn multiple instances of antisemitic vandalism discovered there this week, including Swastika on playground equipment that was brought to our attention by concerned residents.

As a former police officer, longtime civic leader and a father, I am truly disgusted by the existence of this antisemitic vandalism in one of our beloved parks. The unfortunate reality is that this antiSemitism still exists across our nation and we must always be vigilant and never let our guard down. As co-chair of the town’s Graffiti Task Force, I will work with my fellow Town Board colleagues and members of the community to address these hate crimes. The Town Board has already doubled fines for graffiti.

In response to the discovery of the antisemitic vandalism at the town park, Supervisor Clavin, myself along with the Town Board immediately directed the Parks and Public Safety Departments to enhance patrols and perform additional check-ups and inspections of equipment at parks facilities. We will work with parks personnel and other departments to discuss enhanced security measures such as the installation of security cameras. The Nassau County Police Department has been notified and is conducting an investigation.

To report any other incidents on Town Property located in my district please call my office during buisness hours @516-812-3285 or via email @ ccarini@tohmail.org. We will make sure that the graffiti is removed and Police are notified.

cc Councilman Anthony D'Esposito, Councilman Dennis Dunne, Sr.,Hempstead Town Clerk Kate Murray Clavin and the Town Board directed the Parks and Public Safety Departments to boost patrols and perform additional check-ups and inspections of park equipment. Officials said they will work with parks staff and other departments to discuss enhanced security measures, including possibly installing cameras at some locations.

""No person should ever feel threatened because of their religion, and we're here to stand together to assure members of our township's Jewish community and of all faiths that we are unified against hate of all forms,"" Dunne said.

Carini said he was ""truly disgusted"" by the vandalism.

""The unfortunate reality is that this antiSemitism still exists across our nation, and we must always be vigilant and never let our guard down,"" Carini said.

The Amherst College Hillel community is deeply affected and hurt by the use of the swastika, a symbol which is a direct assault on our Jewish identities and many other minority groups represented on campus. Our hearts are with those students as well and we hope to stand together in these times.

That this is the second event of its kind in less than two years illustrates the insensitivity that individuals in the Amherst community feel towards their Jewish classmates, faculty, staff, and other marginalized community members. We, like everybody else on campus, deserve the opportunity to fully express our beliefs, customs, and culture without fear of discrimination. Hillel works hard to establish a community in which all students can feel at home and accepted on campus. Events like those from this past weekend undermine our efforts and we will not stand for them.

We are working diligently with the administration to ensure that students’ concerns are addressed and that antisemitism is both acknowledged and properly addressed on campus. In the past, the administration has shown a lack of urgency in including Hillel in its response to this type of event. This time around, we hope that our inclusion will ensure that Amherst’s response is as strong as the emotion that a swastika invokes in members of our community and others on campus. We hope that student voices are heard and included and, more than anything, that the college can work towards creating the safe environment for all students that it has failed to foster in the past. 

This hateful symbol’s appearance on Amherst property is likely no accident given the college’s history of complacency and noninterference in instances of bias. We write this statement to uphold the fact that Amherst cannot, should not, and will not be a place where this sort of hate is tolerated and harbored. The administration has a duty to Hillel, its Jewish students and faculty, Jewish members of the town and the community as a whole to take stronger action than in the past.

One event of such magnitude is intolerable to us, and that this should happen a second time in over 800 students’ tenure at Amherst is unconscionable. We demand real changes and concrete actions, rather than insincere, repetitive, and unsubstantiated promises and apologies. Only if such action is taken will Jewish students be able to feel safe on campus, and more so, supported by an administration that claims to prioritize its students’ wellbeing over the college’s public image.

We want something to be done about hatred in our community. But more than that, we want human beings to treat each other with respect and common decency. As long as Nazi imagery remains on Amherst’s campus, it is not a safe place. The people who propagate and, more perniciously, tolerate these symbols contribute to an unsafe and hostile environment for us all while also diminishing the steps that committed members of the community have taken toward true acceptance at Amherst.

They are investigating it as a possible hate crime. Miri Cypers, director of the Anti-Defamation League office in Seattle, said it was a “disturbing” incident.

“Our Center on Extremism reviewed the flyers and has not seen this kind of activity elsewhere in Washington or other places in the country. They have seen individuals brag about the distribution online but thus far, we can’t find a specific group they are associated with,” Cypers said. “A swastika is a symbol of people perpetuating violence against other people,” Mayor Seth Fleetwood told The Bellingham Herald in an email.

“It has no place in a civilized society. Here in Bellingham we condemn it entirely. This appalling display of hate and intolerance does not reflect the values of our community,” Fleetwood said.

Rabbi Joshua Samuels of Temple Beth Israel in Bellingham told The Herald in an interview that he learned of the incident early Saturday, which is the Jewish Sabbath.

“It breaks my heart,” he said, adding that hate speech has been increasing with the current political climate.

“They’ve been emboldened to do this over the past several years and I think we all know why,” Samuels said. “It’s horrible to see that kind of hate in this world.”",spree: several stickers; article discusses how Use of a swastika is one of two acts of terror cited in Washington state’s hate-crime legislation. at least one business owned by person of color who says they take such incidents personally,police/sheriff,other,"police/sheriff

I think all people understand the meaning of the symbol, but it means more to the Jewish people.”

When he first learned of the vandalism, Blattman held off calling the police. But on Sunday, Oct. 25, after speaking to some members of the Jewish community — including Sheryl Bronkesh, president of the Phoenix Holocaust Association, who encouraged him to report the incident — he changed his mind and contacted Scottsdale police. Though vandalism of a political sign is a crime in Arizona, Blattman reported this as a hate crime.

“It took me a couple hours to realize that it wasn’t just an antisemitic attack on me, on a public sign,” Blattman said. “It is an attack on all Jewish people. It doesn’t matter that it’s [on] my forehead — it’s a symbol to all Jews. So I realized I had a responsibility to shine a light on it.”

Scottsdale police confirmed the incident is being investigated, though not as a hate crime.

“The term ‘hate crime’ is not a criminal act so much as it is a designation made by prosecutors in seeking enhanced sentencing,” said Sgt. Brian Reynolds, of the Scottsdale Police Department, via email. “That determination would be made when/if an arrest and conviction are obtained.”

State Rep. Aaron Lieberman (LD-28) spoke about the vandalism during a public hearing on Holocaust education on Monday, Oct. 26. “This idea of Holocaust education is so important because it helps people understand the roots of this horrible stuff,” he said. While he’s grateful he never experienced a similar incident in his political career, he was shocked at what Blattman faced. “There’s no place for any attack based on religion or race or anything like that,” he said.  “During this very challenging election season we are disgusted to see this kind of hate directed towards a candidate or his campaign,” said Tammy Gillies, ADL’s interim regional director in Arizona, via email. “While we may disagree with each other on various issues, there is no place for this type of hate in civil discourse.""",candidate is jewish,homeowner/car owner,letters/statements,"homeowner/car owner

Klamath Falls Equity Task Force member Joey Gentry said the vandalism is an example to her of why it is necessary that the city consider a resolution to declare racial inequality a public health crisis in Klamath Falls. For those who don’t experience racism on a daily basis, public displays of hate-symbols are proof that racism does exist in the city, said Gentry.

“I hope that our community sees this as an opportunity to notify our councilors to take a personal stand against racism and oppressive actions,” she said.  Gentry, a member of the Klamath Tribes, wasn’t surprised that neo-Nazi beliefs exist in Klamath after her experiences protesting downtown. She said she’s had people drive past her and other protesters and yell “white power” at her and her group.

Extra penalties for a bias incident could include sensitivity training to diverse communities, community counseling programs or payments to community-based organizations that provide service to victims of bias incident crimes, he said.    ADL New Jersey/New York Director Scott Richman said vandalism including swastikas are common forms of “shock” graffiti in the United States, which are often spray-painted by juveniles. “[These people] are not actually white supremacists but simply want to use the image to shock and alarm people,” Richman said. He said the swastika is a common symbol in Asia used by religious groups, but its use by the Nazi Party in the early 20th century permanently altered the symbol’s meaning.“Since 1945, the swastika has served as the most significant and notorious of hate symbols, antisemitism and white supremacy for most of the world outside of Asia,” he said. Richman added, “In the United States, the swastika is  overwhelmingly viewed as a hate symbol.”     “Making sure people know about it and it’s happening in our town is important,” said Ethan Prosnit, senior rabbi at Temple Emanu-El. “Recognizing that there is hate graffiti, antisemitism and other incidents like this have happened and not just sweeping it under the rug is important. Many people think it is just ignorance and just a sign, but I think people need to know the meaning behind the swastika.”",,police/sheriff,letters/statements,"police/sheriff

In recent years, our schools have engaged in anti-racist educational programming, for both students and staff, designed to broaden perspectives and create greater cultural awareness. We are fully committed to continuing this work as, clearly, we still have much to do when it comes to embodying a fully inclusive, hate-free, and understanding community.”   Police involvement

Counselors will be provided to talk to students about the incident, and staff and teachers will also have opportunities to discuss the matter.

""I am disgusted by reports of anti-Semitic graffiti that was recently found scrawled on the side of Mesilas Bais Yaakov in Brooklyn. This bigoted attack - which came as the family of New York celebrated Hanukkah - is simply despicable, and the fact that these vandals targeted an institution focused on educating our children makes their act of hate even more reprehensible. Over the last nine months, New Yorkers have shown that we are both united and loving, and we will not let those who wish to divide us succeed. In New York, we are committed to protecting those who are targeted because of who they are or what they believe, and I am directing the New York State Police Hate Crimes Task Force to immediately offer assistance in this investigation.""

This incident is not representative of the dedicated, decent women and men in our agency. “I have been in contact with the Anti-Defamation League of New England and will engage their invaluable training programs and resources for every member of the Marblehead Police Department. “Furthermore, I will commission an independent administrative review and retain an outside investigator to conduct a holistic finding of fact so that we can learn all of the facts of this incident and include it in our training programs. “I apologize to our community for this deeply disturbing and unfortunate situation, and I vow to do everything and engage every resource available to ensure that this kind of incident does not repeat itself in the future.”; ADL contacted for training; officer placed on admin leave; he ultimately resigned ",office scratched swastika on fellow officer's car,business owner,suspension/denial of access to space,"business owner
